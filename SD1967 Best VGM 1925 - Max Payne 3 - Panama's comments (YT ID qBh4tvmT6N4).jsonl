{"cid": "UghR_PLlADmEEngCoAEC", "text": "I finished this game recently and while I do think they strayed a bit too far away from what truly defined the first 2 games in terms of story and presentation, I still loved Max's tale of the old undercover cop turned bodyguard in Brazil. The gameplay really is what put this above the rest however, and quickly thinking about it, this might be my favorite pure TPS of all time. Slow mo, diving, precision aiming... all of this makes it so satisfying. The level design was beautiful, but a bit too linear for my tastes. The soundtrack was very good, with this particular theme standing out to me during the boat mission in Panama. This game being made by Rockstar instead of Remedy, I was cautiously excited and it turned out to be great. Now I really have to wonder why Rockstar doesn't use this shooter's mechanics for its GTA series.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "18", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
