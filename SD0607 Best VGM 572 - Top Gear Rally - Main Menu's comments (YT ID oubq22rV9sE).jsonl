{"cid": "UgzuO3ovaOfsgiPqpdN4AaABAg", "text": "You have to understand folks. Top Gear Rally for Nintendo 64 for the USA make. Whether you've played the European Top Gear Rally or the Japanese Top Gear Rally. European and Japanese style music, it's portrayed for their genre. The USA version was designed for our genre. As a musician you learn to love all kinds of music. To be honest I love this USA Top Gear Rally song. The song is not dramatic. I'm 43 Years old. My brother is 38 years old. We still play this game, today. The Top Gear  Rally USA version is one of the most memorable racing games we've ever played on Nintendo 64. The song that you hear when you're painting your car is all in the same package with the Main Menu Soundtrack. The USA version is what we grew up with. I believe most people do not appreciate much of anything. I look forward to recreating the main menu song, a lot of looping, back and forth listening to grab the piano chords, counterparts, melodies. I always loved to design paints to put on the car. Anyways, learn to like appreciate music.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Hellscythe77", "channel": "UCxDAo2aTyWwJYXV5pW3D6Kg", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzrB9kXfA9EQZXOz4iSGTYTB2a-exKO0AfuYuPm6w=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
