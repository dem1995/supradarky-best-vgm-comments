Then Yuriev unites an embryonic Metempsychosis with the Zohar giving it it's true form,  Deus. Abel then wilfully climbs inside the Res Novae, turning it into an imperfect Xenogears. Deus proceeds to infect Razael central and take over the ship, however Abel, Shion, and KOS MOS are able to wound Deus, forcing it to abandon its immediate plans of boarding the Merkabah. In a financial act of vengeance, it uses Zohar to release U-DO which absorbs Shion into the higher dimension, and kills the others, even chaos. Their fate to be reincarnated on the new planet below due to Zarathustra, Deus bides its time with the intent to activate the song of Nephilim and turn the lambs of the new Jerusalem into gnosis to be consumed as fuel so that it can finally ascend and go on to consume planet after planet. In this way it hopes to gain the power to enter the higher dimension on its own and control all existence. In Xenogears we see the final incarnation of Abel,  Fei finally destroy Deus using the perfect power of Zohar. However, it still leaves the Zarathustra, which I believe KOS MOS and possibly Shion would come back to help destroy in episodes beyond Xenogears.
