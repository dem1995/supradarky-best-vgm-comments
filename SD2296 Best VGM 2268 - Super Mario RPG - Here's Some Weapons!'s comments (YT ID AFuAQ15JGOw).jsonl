{"cid": "UgxZF1dmDP9n9mzFmf94AaABAg", "text": "sorry for going off topic from your video, but since you made it not long ago, you're likely to see my comment, which may interest a Mario fan as yourself. I'm making a video of Mario fighting Bowser, but physically and directly, because I'm tired of him always depending on weapons that are conveniently there for him (e.g., projectiles, magical objects, or harmful machines). I have three questions you might have the answer to. One, I'm thinking about having Bowser set a portion of the ground on fire, so Mario could wall jump and knock Bowser into the fire. Mario avoids Bowser's fire breath or fireball by going around the koopa, and as the fire starts and Bowser turns around, Mario hits the wall behind Bowser and jumps off of it, kicking or slamming Bowser so he falls into the fire behind him. Think this is likely to work, or that there are big obstacles and limits for Mario? Two, if Mario kicked Bowser's face with the move from ​https://img.neoseeker.com/view.php?entityid=75283&imageid=441900 would it knock the koopa backwards? If Bowser fell on his shell, Mario could then ground pound his stomach. And three, I'm using Bowser's most common moves for my video--his fire breath, shell spin, scratches, jumps/stomps, and charging. I want to take advantage of Bowser's size and strength, so do you know what his most common physical attack is, besides the ones I've already mentioned?", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Jack Smith", "channel": "UCeErzdJdfzKX81Ss3NXV4CA", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzX0YYJMzFk3d3aTrv92mTVOxsPFNoVUVgBtQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
