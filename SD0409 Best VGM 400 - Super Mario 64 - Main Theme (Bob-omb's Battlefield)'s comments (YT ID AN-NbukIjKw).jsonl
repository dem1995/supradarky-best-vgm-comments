In that time my mind was fascinating to discover who where the other robots, their pilots, their histoy. Today I have a great culture of this kind of genre. For me each time I play a Supor Robot Taisen I enjoy in a special and personal way, it's very dificult to explain it in a few sentences...\nWell in resume, there was a lot of game that impact me but that make that I enter in a unknown world of super robot as he did Super Robot Taisen 4... it's unique.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Ororu Kaiza", "channel": "UCNDPDzd0FsGMiXwDy6vKDJg", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxZ36LKKYEB1nm8RZ36pWenyfdfHD9jY0CaI1Fi=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
