{"cid": "Ugw4FVSh5-ZEBuvK7Op4AaABAg", "text": "A few very big weeks at work required my full focus, but I'm back and finally catched up with all the E3 conferences/news. Great showings overall, though I was definitely disappointed on Nintendo's front, even if I understand their commitment to focusing on the short term games. It also doesn't help that I have never been the biggest fan of the Smash series, so I'm sure those who are enjoyed it. I really wanted some news on the next Retro game and Metroid Prime 4, but it looks like we will have to wait. I'm glad to see Hollow Knight on Switch now and getting the visibility/success it so much deserves. It took long thoughts for me to choose this game over BOTW as my GOTY in 2017, but I still stand by it. I wonder now if more people played it and see where I was coming from!", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "32", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
