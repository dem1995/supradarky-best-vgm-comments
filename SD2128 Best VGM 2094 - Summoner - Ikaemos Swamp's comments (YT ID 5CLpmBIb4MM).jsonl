Let's get this started again if my schedule could just calm down a bit. I feel like Summoner was a very underrated PS2 launch game, it was quite the solid RPG. Nothing groundbreaking, but it didn't need to be. The soundtrack was impressive and I love this theme; its steady beat and repetitiveness actually makes it addictive and I often end up replaying it a couple times. It slightly reminds me of Wounded Warsong from Silent Hill 4 which I find addictive for the same reasons.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "20", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
