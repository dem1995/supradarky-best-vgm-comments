{"cid": "Ugh-Oo-idHhC33gCoAEC", "text": "I finished this game recently and the verdict? Awesome. Only a couple minutes in and I was already blown away by the polished 2D art style, the music and the emotional plot, and it never let go. It's not often you see a game in this genre going for a memorable story with nice twists. Polished really is the word I'd use to describe this game. Controlling Ori feels like a dream, he runs fast right from the start, quickly earns skills that render him super agile and you can almost save anywhere, which gave me that emulator Save State feel. Because of that, the platforming and exploring are absolutely top notch. I do have to say that I found the combat system very average, to the point where I almost wonder if this could have just been a platforming Metroidvania. Ori is assisted by a sort of fairy called Sein who's the one taking care of the enemies by shooting them down, homing into them automatically at the press of a button. Because of that, the only part of combat that requires skill is dodging, not attacking. The problem is that dodging some of the enemies' attacks is either incredibly difficult because they're coming at you way too quickly and randomly (mostly bullet type attacks), or by the end mostly useless as you have enough HP to tank them and easily restore your health afterwards. Still, the rest of the game is so good and rewarding that I 100%'d it and still wanted more. I'm very excited for the sequel!
