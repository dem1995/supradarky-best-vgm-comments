{"cid": "UghRmBL8spDyOHgCoAEC", "text": "I played this game very late in 2013 and wasn't ready for such a deep and fun metroidvania. The production values really surprised me, starting with the clean graphics and one of my favorite soundtracks of the year, if not my favorite. The soundtrack is massive with 36 tracks, so for 5 bucks I just had to buy it. I can hear some similarities to Yamane's music. I really like how this game has tons of gameplay variety and customization with its skill trees, magic spells, equipment and playable characters to choose from. The boss battles are especially fun.\n\nIt has a couple unfortunate flaws though, the biggest one being some frustrating platforming sections mixing precise jumps with sensitive controls and hostile monsters. Another flaw is how terrible the map system is: you can't zoom out of your zone to see the whole map, making it very confusing and difficult to remember how to go back to a specific zone. I wasted a lot of time just running around because of that.\n\nOverall a very good surprise made possible through Kickstarter!", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "25", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
