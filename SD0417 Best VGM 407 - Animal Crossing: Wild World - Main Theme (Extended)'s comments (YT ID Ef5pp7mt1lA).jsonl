They removed resetti from newer games for apparently making kids cry, they changed the artstyle from this lovely slightly muted but aesthetically pleasing one to a bright pastel cancer with horrible tacked on lighting effects and filters, the character models have become realistic for some reason and stick out like sore thumbs, and worst of all the older games have more features than new horizons, and people are fine with this because of updates after launch. Another awful thing is the writing, the villagers feel so soulless and empty in the newer games, the writing quality tanked. \n\nUtterly ridiculous, be sure to buy the gamecube version while you can.

{"cid": "UgxV81aNJI40oQqOobZ4AaABAg", "text": "Imagine a prequel Animal Crossing game with a more structured narrative. ‘Animal Crossing Origins’ or something. I know that seems to immediately go against AC’s design as an open-ended life-sim. But this could be sort of like a spin off! You’re still the resident human who’s new in town. Villagers still move in and out and get you to run around doing favours. The core game play is still pretty similar. \n\nThe difference is that this is also an origin story for characters like Tom Nook and Redd. They live in your town like normal villagers and ask for favours and whatnot. But they have an involved story which unfolds at the player’s pace. You learn about their job aspirations and you see their conflicts play out in some depth. \nYou (can choose to) help Tom set up a tiny little shop selling nicknacks. Maybe Redd is close to Tom, so starts helping him out. \nBut Red has some questionable methods which rob Ton the wrong way. He often sells fake goods, or sells things at exorbitant prices. This angers Tom, and the two drift apart over time.\nThat’s when the two place you in the middle. In a heated argument, they ask you whose side you’re on. Your answer will make one of them move out of town. Maybe they leave permanent, but if you write to them enough, they’ll move back, and you can help patch things up with the animal who remained.\n\nAnother plot could feature Joan. She lives much further out from the others, in a dusty hovel near the cliffs. For the first few weeks, it doesn’t seem like anyone’s home when you knock. But occasionally, when you’re out wondering the forest, you see Joan planting and plucking turnips. She acts pretty distant and aloof, but might sell you some Turnips. The more you do this, the more she talks to the player. She eventually starts having more involved conversations, eg she’ll ask what the other villagers are like.\nIt starts to become pretty obvious that she’s lonely and doesn’t speak to the other villagers, mostly just staying inside her far off house. Once she gets to know you, she starts inviting you over to her house. \nThe closer she gets to you, the more confident and sociable she becomes. She will eventually start getting more involved with the community - maybe she’ll finally move out of her old house and into the central forest where the others live. Depending on how friendly you were to Joan, she’ll either: leave you her house for free; sell you her house at a modest price; sell her house to Tom Nook (which the player can then purchase at full price). \nYour closeness to Joan (and subsequently what she does with her house) could depend on several factors, like how much you spoke with her, your dialogue options, how many Turnips you bought, etc. One key way of increasing your friendliness to her would be delivering her mail to her. Maybe since her house isn’t registered, her mail gets left at the post office. The player can choose to deliver it to Joan themselves. \n\nI think this approach could be really neat. I’d want the general vibe to be more like the Game Cube title. So, more slow, melancholic and acoustic music. The setting is a huge, sloped forest, with a river leading down to the beach. There’s a big emphasis on nature. So buildings are mostly wooden and shack-like. There’re lots of dusty trails and overgrown patches. The whole place is sort of like a big, nostalgic meadow. This is in contrast to New Lead and NH, which tend to be a lot more energetic and modern (still love them of course).\n\nTldr An Animal Crossing Prequel game featuring character backstories. :)", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Blue Ribbon", "channel": "UCuqdt_mhT08AEPS-0pNPU1w", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJx9yN1TpZ4qNIu2Rd4ZaoQmSoKcLHnwg8AY_-g7=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

{"cid": "UgyoHX8SIXaWrU4gEjR4AaABAg", "text": "It would’ve been October of 2008 perhaps (or shortly after), when I first played Wild World. I’d recently gotten a DS Lite for my 10th birthday and a few games, but a family friend of ours was really into “hacking” etc, and gave me an R4 card for free with about 40 pre-installed games on it. Wild World was one of those, and I can literally pinpoint the memory of loading it up for the first time. It was a school night, I was up late in bed trying as many different games as I could on this R4 and obviously came across Animal Crossing. I was immediately entranced by the music, characters, everything. I’d never played an Animal Crossing game before then and ended up having literally a sleepless night 😂 if I remember correctly, I faked being sick the following day and just continued playing. Shortly afterwards I bought an actual Wild World cartridge out of respect for the game. Already owning a Wii, you can imagine how ecstatic I was when finding out Let’s Go to the City existed. Definitely a massive part of my childhood, I’ve played every game since, but this one will always technically be the first for me.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "HMS", "channel": "UCs35AbW10c9lQAzjejByMCw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzog95PTykvukO51zuqyzQc8S5eDtpeyt_y1_oHcg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

The first few seconds I didn't recognize, but when 00:35 kicked in, I was immediately engulfed in a warm, nostalgic hug. I spent hundreds of hours with this game, easily, doing everything possible in it. So many late nights, up with my red OG Nintendo DS, listening to the game through a pair of Nintendo-branded over the ear headphones. Or at sleepovers with my friends, running through each others' towns, playing hide and seek or fishing or giving each other tours of our houses. I remember we were racing to see who could get their houses fully upgraded first... I ended up winning that race, as well as receiving the highest grade from the Happy Home Club.\n\nI'm 26 now and that all seems like a lifetime ago.

Me and my sister used to play this game quite a lot with each other and sometimes, if my cousin was over and had her DS, she'd play with us. But for some reason she kinda stopped playing it with us, so it was just me and my sister playing it. We played with each other for a while (like I had said) then we kinda stopped recently, whenever I bring it up she tells me no, and she doesn't give me a reason for it. She's 11 and I'm 14, so she should still be able to play with me and I love the game. I know everyone's gonna be like, \"oh but she's just growing up! That'll happen. Maybe she's just not interested in it anymore.\" But she loved that game, she strived to get a perfect town. She always asks me to play games with her, so she still wants to play games with me. Basically, I have no one to play with and I see all these stories how when someone was 14 they'd  play all day long or something like that. I just miss having someone to play with.

This is also, at least in my interpretation, the reason why your character is the only human being in a town full of animals. You are an outcast, a completely new face trying to adapt in an already closely-knit community. And what's more, you're on your own. Your friends and family are far, far away.\n\nNew Leaf and all the spin-offs following it completely throw this out the window in favor of making the player this important, powerful figure from the get-go. From the moment you step off that train, everyone in town worships you as if you were the second coming of Jesus. It just feels... wrong.

We would play them for hours on end, and even tried to get my mom to play the first when we were little... ah memories... So I really wanted my own since she owned both. So around Christmas that year, I remembered that an old friend of mine's sister had an Animal Crossing game for the DS... called Animal Crossing: Wild World. I then asked my Aunt for it, and on Christmas Eve, got it. I remember playing it all night, and all morning. Soon enough though, I got new games, and forgot all about Wild World, playing occasionally on holidays... I have started playing it again though, and hope to play it along with New Leaf. Sadly, my sister never got back into Animal Crossing, or video games period... so now I kind of just play them by myself, except with my (female) cousins every once and a while, probably because I am the only boy on that side, an on my other side I have a guy cousin, but he's \"too old\" to play video games, much less then even with me, his younger cousin to bond... And most kids would probably laugh at the fact that I only play Nintendo, since they play first person shooters... I wish I could re-live my Animal Crossing (the first, that is) days, when everyone in my family loved video games, aside from my uncle who still does, and everyone at school loved Nintendo with a passion... :'(\nEdit: Hey, at least I have a few friends in school that like Nintendo like me!\nAnd one's a girl! :D\nPlus, there's the internet!
