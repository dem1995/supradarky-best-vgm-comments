Sure more characters and 3d are nice, but it never actually felt like a bit trip. Flux felt like a missing piece to me the more I understood it. It actually disappoints me. The series of bit trip never gained the popularity of any other game. Really in my opinion is more deserving than sonic (which is slowly dying). But in summary: Bit trip needs more recognition for it's games for Nintendo to actually care for it.
