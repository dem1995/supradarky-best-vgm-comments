{"cid": "UgjrS1HSuuqRengCoAEC", "text": "I never played the original Rise of the Triad, which is a classic, but I gave this remake a shot last week and finished it in ~5 hours. It was actually quite addicting as I'd always want to play another level and frankly, it just was very refreshing to play a classic-style run and gun shooter, where your only objective is to kill everything you see while trying to find secret chambers. However, there's a big lack of enemy variety and their AI is borderline atrocious. Some platforming sequences can also be frustrating and have no place in such a game. Bonus points for the humor which the original game is known for, as well as the great soundtrack, with mostly rock/metal tracks and then suddenly a completely out of place Adagio cover for one of the levels because... why not?", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "14", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
