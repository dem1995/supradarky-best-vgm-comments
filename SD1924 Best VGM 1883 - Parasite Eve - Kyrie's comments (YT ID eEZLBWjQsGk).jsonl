Shimomura's awesome soundtrack matched the game's masterful and chilling atmosphere. Eve has to be one of my favorite female antagonists in a video game, you truly felt like she posed a threat. I remember Eve being on the scene in Central Park, this theme starts playing, the FMV kicks in and while she sings in front of the spectators, she manipulates their mitochondria and melts them into slime. The mix of the calm music and the horrible scene worked so well.
