These past 2 weeks were really pleasant and I took quite some time off to be lazy and play video games. Oh and as always, I ate too much. I have not played this game yet, but I will just for its soundtrack alone as it's one of my favorites of the year. At this point, I'm not sure if being associated to a bad movie hurt its sales or if it actually helped, because of how out of left field this is. Looking at reviews, it seems to be a pretty solid metroidvania.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "30", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
