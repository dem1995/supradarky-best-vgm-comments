Soundtrack wasn't really as good(my little brother got excited when this song started playing during Gilgamesh fight, noting how suddenly the music got more interesting), and plot was pretty difficult to follow and not too interesting. Final battle was mostly just bothersome, and not epic at all.\n\nXII was an awesome game, and I've been playing it through every year or so ever since it was released, and I keep finding new things on each playthrough.

X didn't feel like a FF game, aside from the combat. Neither did X-2, or XIII, again all aside from the combat. XII definitely didn't have the same feel with the music, but I think that's where that line ends.\n\nI like FF for it's RPG elements, the story/lore, but I'd have to say the turn based ATB combat was never really my favourite part. It was slow and boring, requiring you to do no more than press \"Attack\" and \"Cure/Potion\" at low health to win, and statuses were nearly useless on anything.¬†\n\nIn XII it retains the same feel of turn based combat while being faster paced, more tactical, offering freedom of choice to use magic, statuses, different weapon types with different effects. It felt more like a FF game with it's open world, high level areas you could explore way before you should be there, super secret treasures you could find or farm, and most fun of all, hunt logs.¬†\n\nI think most people don't like XII because it decides to change things up a little, and people don't like change. But in reality, the change was smaller than they think, not much more than adding movement to the combat. It is, IMO the best FF to date.
