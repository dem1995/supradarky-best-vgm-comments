I remember seeing Rito Village from super far away and deciding to head straight for it. It felt like a journey, going through various terrain obstacles and monsters, spending many nights by the fire outside, and then finally arriving at the destination. As you approach, you slowly start hearing the soothing village theme as if it's welcoming you after the harsh road (and as a bonus, a rendition of Wind Waker's Dragon Roost Island). BOTW is all about these kind of moments.", "time": "8 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "61", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
