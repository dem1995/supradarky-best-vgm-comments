The damn jerk jebaited me with the Clocktower 3 case, but had Tales of Legendia in it. He ended up lending it to me for a while, and i spent a lot of time playing it. I vividly remember this song, though I don't remember where it plays exactly, I know its definitely in the early game. I think while you're on your way to a town in the beginning? \n\nAnyway, I had this song on my PSP since way back when.
