I had never worried so much about a character before. It was raining and, although we didn't had a timer, I was desperate to save her. It's pretty obvious that she can't die in this part, but I appreciate the fact that they didn't include a timer, because of the uncertainty, I didn't know if I had a time limit or not, so I just dashed through this part as fast as I could so that she wouldn't die.\nI hate the fact that this music is interrupted by the battle music though, even on the HD Remake, it breaks the feeling completely, but this is still one of my favorite moments from all the games that I played.\nAnother thing thought, Midna's Desperation Hour (Midna's Lament) from Super Smash Bros. is a clearer version, it's, sadly, better than the game's version, you can notice how the melody from the piano is a bit muffed in this version.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Not A Cat", "channel": "UCWI8d20aqJHFjhUg8FLuKyg", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwtdMQRcVTtRQGtplw4tUhWpJyC-BYOkrW75rYdxQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
