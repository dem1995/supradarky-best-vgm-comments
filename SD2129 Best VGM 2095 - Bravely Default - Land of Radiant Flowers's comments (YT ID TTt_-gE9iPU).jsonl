The problem is that the game likes to reiterate upon itself far too often than one should expect from a single playthrough, and this leads to you feeling like you're going around in circles. This is intentional, but it really isn't a good feeling to have when its unclear if you've actually made any progress in the time you've spent playing the game.

After listening to it, I was very surprised with how great it sounded.  This theme in particular is one of my favorite \"Land\" themes in the entire game.  I should also say that all the character themes in this game are great as well.  I'm shocked that this is only the second song you've uploaded from this game.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Eric C.", "channel": "UCW-NCSWtwr76dBreDd6jAYw", "votes": "8", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwZUTZb5cKg6joDbmEtTsOCxELWMYvBf92-CCID=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
