Jak 2 and 3 are great games too, especially 2, but just didn't do it for me due its darker atmosphere. The RaC games are really great too, but the only one that I was compelled to beat was 3, because my first game copy was scratched to hell and the second one wasn't too captivating for me. So, I must say: JaD series. ", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "PlayingItOldSkool", "channel": "UCmtAF1JbVeMx9aXatlxgm1g", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyJmu_dIO588LRlQ5bE3S-R61UxzqlM5EKxioiH=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

I can see how the seamless world of Jak and Daxter was appealing at the time but R&C stands the test of time much better. J&D is just a 3D-platformer that is so much worse in every aspect compared to a game like Banjo-Kazooie. The jokes are pretty bland, so are the characters. It seems to me like the game tried to be \"cool\", something that Sonic is suffering from as well. The camera, the levels, the missions (way too many \"collect X orbs\"-missions)  - and the game just did not have too many ideas. One or two levels were above average, the rest of the game is forgettable imo. R&C however is a whole different thing - it really is a great game of it's own, combining elements of different genres and is still feeling fresh today. And from what I heard about the other entries of the game series, R&C has been getting better and better, while J&D went the opposite way.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "BeleuchteteBrueder", "channel": "UC_rIKK0_dxDqKt8tYMdNLFg", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyT5NSPlq8gdf6-7pnudeRKnxv3xpIkBjyQJiA4=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

Ratchet and Clank games have great gunplay mechanics and (sometimes) great plots, but Jak and Daxter games have great gunplay (since Jak II), great platforming, great plots, great music, great missions and better replay value. Ratchet and Clank is more action-adventure with some shooting elements, rather than a platformer, and if you like to shoot and smash things, which in one way is fun, but in other way - tedious and monotonous, so, this game for you. Not to mention, I don't understand people who tell that J&D games are worse than Banjo-Kazooie games (which really badly aged). You can disagree with me, but I, as a critic, think, that at least the first J&D and Jak 3 are much more playable and meaningful than all Banjo-Kazooie and Ratchet and Clank games.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Leo Rack", "channel": "UCVCi9CFoBwdeyj_XzOuIDfg", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz8OhV08Jk8Bc925w9OKBCwU5HZKF0sx0W5NFxbag=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
