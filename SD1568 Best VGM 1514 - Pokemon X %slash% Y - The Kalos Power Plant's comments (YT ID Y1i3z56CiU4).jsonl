Gen 6 in general just feels incredibly meh. Kalos is occasionally cool looking, but actually travelling across it is surprisingly boring, not least of all because of how mind-dullingly easy they made all the combat. I don't need a massive challenge, but when I can beat every single \"boss\" battle first try without loosing any Pokemon, grinding, or even optimizing my team in any way (and considering I've always been pathetic at these games) the game's too easy. It's a real downgrade considering how great Black and White (both 1 and 2) were. Sun and Moon are looking great, though.

Unfortunately, I felt that I my expectations for this generation simply were not met. The game's features were not up to the standards they could be.\n-It is still a very tedious game to play if you want a Pokemon team to your exact needs. The IV's and EV's are not easily displayed, and the Pokemon breeding process was almost not described at all.\n\n-The Pokemon themselves were not balanced well: The mega-evolutions brought in a mechanic that made it so you had to choose particular Pokemon to compete. There was only one new poison type?\n\n-The battles are slower than they should be, which adds up if you battle often.\n\n-The character customization is worse and more generic than the first Sims.\n\n-The battle music itself is mind-numbingly repetitive and only changes on special occasions.\n\n-Every Pokemon is not readily available through these two games, and some of them are only available through the friend safari, which is just the developers way of involving people you meet on your DS.\n\n-The story and plot layout has not changed much at all. You still go through the same process, to go to the same place. It is like they made this game so similar to the first generation on purpose, just so Nintendo fans can remain in their nostalgic bubble.\n\n-While I appreciate the Pokemon being represented in 3D models and having unique animations (which turned out pretty damn awesome), I don't understand why they did not innovate just as much to the entire game itself.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Obby", "channel": "UCB4qx6aknMONopsjwL6W38Q", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyumeB3xSLXXTC9wlvHOfAyBowM_FjiQ3QxzZPUbQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
