{"cid": "UgzLWGcgxcUcjLh7PbN4AaABAg", "text": "The Nintendo Direct just ended and with Joker in Smash, I keep thinking we'll get some Persona ports on the Switch but it's not happening so far. I'm excited for the new SMT game though, even if there was no news on that. There's also Tokyo Mirage Session getting a Switch release, which is very nice since it was stuck on the Wii U and launched mostly quietly under the radar even if I heard great things about it. The Xenoblade remaster was also a nice surprise, though I wouldn't have expected it to be the Direct's closing announcement. It feels like everytime there is a Direct, I uploaded something related to the big announcement a few days before! Next time I know there is a Direct, I'll upload a Mother 3 track.", "time": "10 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "47", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
