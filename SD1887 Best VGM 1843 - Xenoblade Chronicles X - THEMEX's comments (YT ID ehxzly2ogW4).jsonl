XC feels like the perfect fantasy jrpg, while XCX feels like a completely unique experience unlike any other. Everything form the music, art design, atmosphere and battle system. Another good example of this is how the story in XCX evolves. In XCX, the main chapters are just the main chapters of the story, not the full story. All of the side quests (which is far better than in XC) provides a lot to the story as well. This kind of story telling really fits an open world, but leaves players who wants a more streamlined storytelling, like the one in XC, dissapointment.
