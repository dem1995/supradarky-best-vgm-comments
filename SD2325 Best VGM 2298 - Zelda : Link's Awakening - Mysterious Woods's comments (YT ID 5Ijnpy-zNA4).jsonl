I just cannot help but be worried with its art direction, music included. What makes this game so amazing to me is its unique and darker atmosphere and I'm worried that this essential aspect will be lost. Just thinking about the Face Shrine and its theme for example, I can hardly imagine how it will sound like and can only hope they do it justice.
