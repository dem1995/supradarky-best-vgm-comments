The third part of the game was kinda lackluster and overhyped (we all thought Lennus would look like Lennus but instead it had the same freaking palette the rest of the game did) and then BOOM Mouth Junior and this theme kicks in.

It turned out to be one of my favorite RPGs for the SNES and for a console full of classics, that's very high praise. There's nothing quite like the Paladin's Quest series' strange worlds and atmosphere.
