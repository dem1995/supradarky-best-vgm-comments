{"cid": "UgzAsB7umDIl6fTMqfN4AaABAg", "text": "As I thought before playing this game, this turned out to be a true IGAvania in an awesome but maybe too safe way. There have been many amazing Metroidvanias the past years, but IGA still has his unique touch when it comes to the immense variety of battle mechanics. The fact that there are so many shards (if you played the Castlevania Sorrow games, think of them as souls), each able to go up in rank and grade, makes it almost overwhelming. It's basically a huge sandbox with hundreds of toys. I can imagine the team having fun trying to find new shard mechanics. The music by Yamane is solid but far from her best work and the level design is what I found too safe and slightly unmemorable. I will always prefer a beautiful 2D game than 2.5D. Apart from that, the one negative that stands out is the fact that the game is too easy, which prevented me from truly having fun with the various mechanics and find the ones that work best. I felt overpowered to the point that I would beat bosses before I could even see all their moves. The Hard difficulty should have been the default one. In the end, it's just good to have IGA back doing what he does best.", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "43", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
