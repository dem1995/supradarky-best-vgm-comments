A time when we're told that things were simple and good. But, traveling there themself Chrono and the player see that 600 AD was far from that. Wracked by war and the fear of imminent destruction at the hands of the Magi humanity is barely fending them off. Humanity's victory paints the age in a light of dominance, supremacy, and the victory of their hopes which leads to a rosy interpretation of the events. All of this is interpreted and evoked by the pure emotionality of music in its score. It starts off simple with a few plucks, but then starts to gain more in a deep melody, just in time to enjoy that the song breaks into an almost sad aria, and is then plunged into a muddled and possibly feckless jumble, but it ends in this incredibly powerful and hopeful harmonious resolution, and then goes back to the happy part.\n\nAlso...

The game has bosses, enemies, side quests, and dungeons that set apart each story sequence so you feel motivated to advance through the game in order to see what the next plot point is. Another advantage of the game is that you, as the player, were experiencing everything yourself so you felt a sense of discovery as the plot unraveled.  However, if you imagine how it'd be like in, say, an anime, just imagine how the plot will run through everything.

You're listing the game that is a blatant re-hash and ripoff of Link to the Past as having any kind of merits when someone could literally just play LttP and get the same experience 15 years ago?\nNot to mention nearly every game you've listed here, aside from Dark Souls and Bastion, is hardly the kind of enduring classic Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross were -- and more than that, they're being deliberately retro in a gimmicky attempt to capture the goodwill of gamers who played true masterpieces like CT and CC as well as all the other incredible titles history has produced.\nNo one said that ALL games are shit these days, but the truth is that even so-called \"good\" games in the modern age of triple-a ultra-graphic lens-flare dubstep zombie repetetiveness are usually just imitations or re-imaginings of old games and mechanics introduced back in the golden age of console gaming.\nExceptions to this exist, as I noted above. Bastion and especially Demons' Souls are wonderful examples of games that really brought something new and fresh to the table, which is awesome and we should all be happy about that. However, someone making the true assertion that a huge percentage of modern games are soulless triple-a cash grabs milking fucking stupid 13 year olds out of their money shouldn't be met with criticism just because \"NUH UH, THESE GAMES ARE GOOD AND THEREFORE TOTALLY OUTWEIGH THE HUGE TUMOR THAT'S KILLING GAME DEVELOPMENT SPIRIT AND GAMES AS A MEDIUM!\"", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Old Demosthenes", "channel": "UCOFSHPAK8oBc2aBS1W_d_rA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxnhRRLW7rX8xHXOg8uYbZM9G5pYGHq_B-A9u71=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
