{"cid": "Ugw42yG3DLM2OLDjtUp4AaABAg", "text": "What really gets me about Yormgen in the end is what the party experienced. The song's title implies it was a mirage created by Phaeroh, made to teach the party about the truth behind the clear ciel crystal, but the fact we could interact with the people there as well as the fact Yuefan mentions Longchi disappearing three years ago implies it was more akin to time travel. Of course, the mirage part makes sense since past Yormgen remains on the world map up until a certain point. Even to this day, I'm still not sure which it's supposed to be. \n\nThe mysterious, peaceful, and melancholic tone of the music does add that mystery appeal of never knowing which it is though. It's been one of my favorite tracks since 2008. And hearing it again in the PS4 port reminds me why I fell in love with Vesperia's soundtrack.", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Flegan777", "channel": "UCN2oGASYesvWhUeElvnLHeg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzRZ543HwKDmN6M5i99guFrnc73j2Y2KbkrdQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
