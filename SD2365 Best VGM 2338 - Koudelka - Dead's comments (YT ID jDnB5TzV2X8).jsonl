{"cid": "UgxZcwx9RQnRNZ5gaK14AaABAg", "text": "Hiroki Kikuta has to be one of my favorite people in the gaming industry: he composed the great soundtrack of Secret & Trials of Mana, he then directed and composed Koudelka before starting his own company to continue the Shadow Hearts series. I'm also excited for the latest game he composed, Indivisible. Since my last Koudelka upload, I have now played and completed the game. No idea why I waited so long because I ended up loving almost everything about it, starting with the great dark atmosphere. The story and voice acting were top notch, and there's just something I like about exploring an old mansion. The one thing I can see being a drag if I didn't use an emulator to up the speed was the battle system and some of the grinding I had to do. Apart from that, a very solid game in my book. I was watching a video on YouTube with only the story elements and I really think the voice acting is some of the best on the system, easily.", "time": "9 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "41", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
