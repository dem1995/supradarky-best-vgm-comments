{"cid": "UggFbO68vKjvangCoAEC", "text": "Yep, this is my favorite horror game of all time, the main reason being that I've never been more scared playing a video game than with Fatal Frame II. I remember a particular moment where I played a 1 hour session before having to stop because I actually felt too stressed out, I was so relieved to reach a save point and I turned off the console immediately. The claustrophobic environments, ghosts that can pop out anywhere and anytime, having to go into first person camera to hurt the ghosts, all mixed with an extremely unsettling sound design. The gameplay is very fun as well. I love how the various ghosts (some of them recurring) have backstories: Broken Neck Woman, Fallen Woman, Woman in Box, Sunken Woman, Rope Man, etc.... very memorable. They all have their own \"battle theme\" as well, just listen to the tracks from the ghosts I just mentioned, all very unsettling. It didn't help that I played this game with lights turned off and headphones on, but to me that's how all horror games should be played. This is the theme that plays when you're saving, one of the few times you can feel safe.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "29", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
