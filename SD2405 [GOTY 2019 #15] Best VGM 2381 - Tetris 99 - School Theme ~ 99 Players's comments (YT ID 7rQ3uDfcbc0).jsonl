{"cid": "UgxoN0M9yo6pBXShGwV4AaABAg", "text": "Kicking off my Top 15 of 2019 with a classic with a twist. While Tetis Effect became my go-to version last year, it only took a year with Tetris 99's release for it to become my new #1 Tetris thanks to its addicting online multiplayer. Sure, it doesn't always feel fair when you're suddenly randomly targetted by 5+ players and you go to from a clean board to a catastrophy in a matter of seconds, but the adrenaline rush is amazing. Reaching the top 10 is hard enough, but with the music kicking in you start getting in a zone that feels perfect. I really like the additions of various boards because I was definitely getting tired of the same theme playing all the time. This School feel-good theme is a favorite of mine.", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "21", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
