{"cid": "Ugy1L9Zn4sytGl9a5ft4AaABAg", "text": "It’s weird to think I’m watching number 2352. It might not seem like an important number but… the song which drew me into this channel was 1176. The list seemed huge at the time, but it’s now double that.\n\nUp to 2012, I only listened to soundtracks of games I knew already - Mario and Sonic especially, and Super Smash Bros Brawl. I was subscribed to SD that year because I found some Mario tracks I knew on there, which is arguably missing the point of the channel. I can't remember why I clicked on it, possibly because I found a lot of time on my hands that summer, but Parabolic Hyperflies blew my mind. I hadn't realised I could appreciate game music without knowing the game behind it. But in fact, the unfamiliar games would be the ones I would most appreciate. \n\n1176-1199 became the first snippet of SD which I listened to on repeat, followed by the rest of playlist 6 just as I went to university. The duration of the playlist is only a few hours, but the density of good songs is so high (as with all these playlists) that I could savour it over months.\n \nWhen I left my room, the music would often stick in my head for the day, or multiple days. I keep a note of the songs which stick the most - these aren’t really game songs to me, but a kind of soundtrack to my life. I would start a new playlist every few months (in a non-methodical order), which means I associate different lists with different points in time. \n\nAnd songs on this list have introduced me to full soundtracks I love like Shatter, Neotokyo, Silent Hill, Wangan Midnight, Umineko, Unreal Tournament to name a few.
