Wandering through non-Euclidean levels was a very refreshing and immersive experience, helped by the very atmospheric soundtrack. The music is of course not as effective when heard outside the game, but it can serve as very relaxing ambient background music while you're doing other things (The Garden is easily my favorite). This is actually a short version of Suite II, the whole track is about 23 mins long. An awesome game I'll be replaying, especially if it ends up getting Oculus Rift support!", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "18", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
