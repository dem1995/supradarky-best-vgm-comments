{"cid": "UgwI-IjhCm2-rsQ1tkh4AaABAg", "text": "I'm gonna make a theory that the malice is going to be the main plot point for Breath Of The Wild sequel. Think about it for a second. Ganon was infected by malice, turning him into this weird monster. The guardians and champions divine's were all infected by not Ganon, but malice, the red, creepy stuff you see swarming everywhere in this trailer and in Breath Of The Wild. The malice infected the guardians, which is what made them turn evil in the first place-- even in the trailers for Breath Of The Wild 1 you see Calamity Ganon spewing malice to all of the guardians to destroy Hyrule. This is what Ganon used in the first place, the malice to seek revenge against the guardians as a counter to finally take over Hyrule, which he almost achieved. Countless times throughout Breath Of The Wild, especially the dungeons, that the malice are their own individual evil monsters that try to kill you. When you see the skeleton skulls for Moblins or Bokoblins, you see malice take over, and suddenly they're alive, trying to kill you once again. That \"thing\" in the Breath Of The Wild sequel trailer is the source of all malice; and if you still don't believe me, just look at that things eyes. Those eyes match exactly to the eye-malice monsters in the dungeons of Breath Of The Wild. Zelda most likely knows about the malice, since she was fighting Ganon for 100 years, and was off to a search to find the source of the malice and how to eradicate it from Hyrule. Where they enter is most likely the temple of where the malice originated-- from that \"thing.\" Also, did you see the foreshadowing with the rat being swallowed up by the malice? Nintendo is telling us that the malice not only controls guardians and machines, but also living creatures. Breath Of The Wild 2 is the fight against malice, and all of these factors seem to make my theory very strong.

Think about it, if he already had malice, couldn't he have already taken over the guardians and divine beasts like he does in BOTW? Impa even specifically talks about how they won WITH the guardians and divine beasts, until 100 years ago Ganon used the malice to take over all of the guardians and divine beasts. With that fact present, I think we can safely assume that Ganon acquired the malice somehow.

It literally a physical form of the concept of hatred and evil. Which is terrifying. But what this means I s that ganondorf, being the technical reborn mortal version of demise is simply giving off the malice as an extension of himself. \n\nMy theory is this. The sheikah sealed him down here like this using magic. The legend from 10000 years ago depicts ganon in his calamity wispy form, leading me to believe he was sealed before the events of that legend. Now it may be that the blue and green wisps are simply sheikah tech, but I think that is is power being pulled from ganondorf. I think the machines were built after he was sealed down like this, and then using the power they are gaining from him, they built an army to keep him there. The sheikah have attempted to control things like the triforce in the past after all. And like usual, with the passage of time, the power within ganondorf built up, and seal waned. He couldnnt fully escape however so using the malice he was able to affect the outside world in an attempt to create a new body, either to puppeteer from where he was, or to free his real body.\n\nThis is made more apparent by the eyes that appear in the malice. Which match his eyes in the trailer. He has been watching us with those eyes this whole time. Perhaps this didn’t all go to plan,  but the trailer may be showing us that our heroes lack of knowledge grants the king of evil his freedom.\n\nAnd this is why I love this trailer. The implication is that everything we fought in the last game was just puppets and phantoms leaking from his body. It’s the remnants of his power trickling out a leak in a seal. And once he’s released, his real power can be used.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Cory Brown", "channel": "UCwEEamHSISGHJkeJ7uEcDlw", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzSlWJV4q-Qe2s0FjeOY3I030esrffJx5r8HQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

With skyward sword being the very first game in the timeline. There are multiple hints at this. The master sword for instance was forged by the first hero in skyward sword, thus it must take place after that game. The princess herself makes a ceremonial reference to sky and twilight, referring to both games taking place in the past. The goddess statues make their first appearance in skyward sword. The ruined temple that you can find on the plateau is almost identical to the temple of time from ocarina of time. Similarly in hyrule field you can find Lon Lon ranch in ruins from ocarina of time. The corpse we see in the trailer possesses long red hair, a jewel on its forehead, and both a cloth and earrings possessing the symbol of the gerudo. Ganondorf typically has long red hair, wears a jewel on his forehead, and is a gerudo man.\n\nPrincess Zelda is also the mortal reincarnation of the goddess hylia whose statues you pray to all over hyrule. Zelda appears first in skyward sword, for this game to take place prior Zelda would need to not exist.\n\nWith all this evidence and I believe official statements, the game is placed in the child timeline after four swords adventures.

For instance, I would be okay with a surprise behind the hand on ganondorfs chest or some kind of new crazy detail that changes everything. But I believe most of what I said is accurate regarding ganondorf and the malice/blight.  Topics regarding the guardians and the shiekah technology that is holding him down there I only have theories for.     And while I believe this is the same ganondorf from ocarina, I have no actual evidence to support it, but I maintain that theory because there is also no concrete evidence to suggest he has ever actually died and been reincarnated.
