Conker's Pocket Tales, and Conker's Bad Fur Day. Live & Reloaded doesn't count because it's a ramake, Project Spark is a game that got Conker slapped on it so it would sell better (Conker's not even in the main game!) and Young Conker is an augmented reality game (doesn't count. I'm only counting MAIN games). Hell if you think about it.... Donkey Kong came back with Returns and Tropical Freeze. Banjo came back with the spiritual successor with Yooka-Laylee. What does Conker get? Stuck in Microsoft hell with no bright light in his immediate future. No spiritual successor, no comeback/sequel, nothing he's just dead, probably for good. I mean I know he doesn't have the following that say Banjo or Mario had/have but damn it he's still a great character and had an awesome game. He never got his chance to shine, he never got the chance to make something of himself, he has the two games and that's it. He didn't get half the screen time or credit he deserved. Hell there would've been a Conker's Other Bad Fur Day if Microsoft didn't cancel it. They had a story and everything! And instead he's just.......... gone.
