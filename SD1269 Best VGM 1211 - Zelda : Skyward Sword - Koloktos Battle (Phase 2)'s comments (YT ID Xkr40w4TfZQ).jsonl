I feel like the majority of Skyward Swords music was like this with a few exceptions like Grooses theme. I'm not saying the music is bad it's just not as catchy and memorable as the music in the previous games. Koji Kondo just seems to be making epic sounding music just because it orchestrated. It's strange since Motoi and Kirkhope have no problem with making catchy, memorable songs when they moved on to orchestrated music.", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "eishikibahamut", "channel": "UCOw9HST1jNzU9INKKMQExYA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxi3xL-1ZyQA9Whq40iwzrGgJztW7OvqD2QOQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
