The first game is very slow paced and takes a while to get to the good parts and you can't skip time. You can in Shenmue 2 and the areas to explore are huge and more detailed and the pacing is better. But unless you're a pretty patient player then Shenmue probably isn't a good game series for you.

{"cid": "UgxAFSBf_UCAIgSw2v94AaABAg", "text": "This theme is a masterpiece, just like the series. Honestly, I can't separate Shenmue 1 and 2, they're both tied. I probably have more nostalgia for the 1st (played it around Christmas while it was snowing out my window) but Shenmue II is longer and more polished. Shenmue 1&2 didn't age too well because of the tank controls and the graphics not being mind blowing anymore (they definitely were back then). However the story, the audiovisual presentation and the atmosphere is﻿ still among the best.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
