{"cid": "Ugxa5b_k2MA6S8GtQnJ4AaABAg", "text": "Hearing feedback on this game's slightly disappointing sales directly from Zeboyd Games, it's really quite unfortunate. I've been supporting them since my very first Breath of Death VII upload and I would hate to see them become discouraged and stop making retro RPGs. CSH was far from perfect, but it brought an amazing setting and a unique battle system that pulled the game away from the mediocre story and unmemorable characters. Of course, the soundtrack was a big positive as well. This track is easily one of my favorites, I especially love the calm intro. The great buildup and afterwards also somehow gives me vibes of Starcraft with its drums and instrumentation.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "15", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

I‚Äôll still pick it up on Switch, but I am sad that it did not do well. I hope they bounce back. I really did not hear any marketing about this game past the Sony release earlier last year. I actually got a chance to speak with The Messenger Creative Director and Executive Producer and they said how lucky they were to be promoted by Nintendo and how hard it is to crack into the industry.
