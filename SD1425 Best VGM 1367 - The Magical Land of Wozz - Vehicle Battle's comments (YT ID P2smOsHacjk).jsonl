{"cid": "UgiUrF0pOtICDngCoAEC", "text": "I just finished this game with Chun's ending.. each character has their own ending so I will eventually finish the game 3 times to see them all. I really enjoyed playing the game, it was very fun, but felt that the making of stuff towards the end of the game becomes useless to be honest until you can make Solo the battle robot. Too many boats/airships/robots make most of them useless.. they should have just had 2 variations of each land buggy/boat/airship.. more hps/mp/move faster.. and the battle robots should have really only been about 4 of them throughout times of the game become available. This game is so underrated, it had so much potential to be one of the greatest on the Snes but something just seems not to sit right with it. What bugged me the most was the fact that I could NOT equip anything in Chun's weapon slot. In ANYcase.. i have uploaded a completion video of the last few bosses and the ending of Chun's play through on my channel if anyone is interested in watching it as one of the endings.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "SEG - Sylar Explores Gaming", "channel": "UC5DrStvYrMxTrHZR11paQMA", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzLPs95nHVM0KQFbtPCCf01ml8qutGzp8QOUXhJ_w=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
{"cid": "UghLEpzDN2j45XgCoAEC", "text": "I'm playing the game and i'm enjoying it quite a bit, I think is a great game as long as you don't try to compare it to others \"uber quality\" rpgs of the system, like FF6 and Chrono Trigger.\n\nI like how you can choose betweeen the three main characters, magic \"evolves\", and build a lot of things, the vehicles help a lot when walking around the overworld, as they can defeat enemies like nobody's business and make long journeys less tedious, faster and you waste less time overall. The robots can be helpful in a pinch, but I don't want to abuse their power.\n\nMy only complain could be that magic starts pretty weak until you level it up (Which takes a while, but training in the beginning area helps a lot and it's worth the time as you progress) and sometimes it can be a little slow, but that's more of a quirk of the entire genre by that time. And some bosses require quite a bit of patience, mostly in the beginning.\n\nI'm also quite glad that the battle system is not another Dragon Quest clone. And it's satisfying as hell to been able to walk in 8 directions, for some reason.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Maeson", "channel": "UCQ6sBhl_nCinmDtb5Az2_Ig", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxND-FrMxeR9Vfb88PCrTNF_Oza98FYhzPTs07eMQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

There are ground, sea and air vehicles, each acting as modes of transport on the overworld with powerful battle abilities. I also like how items in this game are actually very good (you can buy 999 of each and they're cheap), without them you won't win many boss battles, especially when it comes to healing.
