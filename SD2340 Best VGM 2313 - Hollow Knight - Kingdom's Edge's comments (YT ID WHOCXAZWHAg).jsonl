The rush you get when you discover a new area, with its name popping on the screen, is always something I loved about metroidvanias. They completely nailed this sense of discovery in Hollow Knight and stumbling upon this area, mixed with the music and the falling bodies from the Colosseum above just made me stop for a moment. Little did I know that I was about to face the most frustrating enemies in the game... the primal aspids.", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "45", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
