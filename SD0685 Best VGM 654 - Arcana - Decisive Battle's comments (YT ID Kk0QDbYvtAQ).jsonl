The difficulty is all over the place, the mapping system would never exist in the form that it was in today's games, the story is just pure unadulterated fuckery. It took me several playthroughs as well as lots of research to figure out who the fuck the hero is talking about in the final boss fight. Even comparing it to games like Paladin's Quest Etc it has glaring flaws I can't ignore. I would like to State for the record I enjoyed the hell out of it. It was one of my favorite games when I was younger. I loved switching spirits on the Fly, and while I will criticize the elemental cards system at used, at the time I found it fresh even if it ran out incredibly quickly and was unnecessarily simple or just plain unnecessary period in the face of so many games that did the same thing so much better in that era, I can comfortably call this one of the worst RPGs released for the SNES. Fuck, even the Dragonball and Sailor Moon RPGs did RPG better.\n\nDefinitely dig pretty much every song from this game though.
