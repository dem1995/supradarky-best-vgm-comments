{"cid": "UghRr8imXwskIXgCoAEC", "text": "Great theme from an odd and excellent game. Naruke was really spot-on in capturing the cold/calculating scientist vibe of the Prophets, who would almost casually blast anyone who interfered with their work with one of those Eliminate Scanner attacks before continuing their investigation of this-or-that ruins/observatory/whatever. It's been a while, so I don't remember what the hell those characters' motivations were, just that they were an extremely off-putting lot who were as persistent as 1990s cartoon-show villains. I'm definitely planning on revisiting this one.
