I only played the Walking Dead games from Telltale which I really liked, but they released so many other series now in the same vein that I kind of got lost. I was disappointed to see that C418 didn't compose for this game, but it certainly seems like it turned out well under Anadel.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "19", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

It doesn’t have as much gameplay integrated in as the Walking Dead or other Telltale games, but the Minecraft charm was what really did it for me. This track was definitely a very fitting one for the setting it took place in.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "GenericYoutubeComment Channel", "channel": "UCfglZIh129ONFlvyPXKNceQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzs_57MPw2RkiEQfB2Jk66_w7uvF98R-9FJHg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
