{"cid": "Ugz6gHohM8gz8sp7f_t4AaABAg", "text": "I feel like this game came out of nowhere last year and quickly developped a nice following, at least during the first few months. It's basically a procedurally generated Souls-like with guns. I enjoyed the game overall mostly thanks to its fun gameplay, despite balancing issues and how generic it feels. I would have a hard time recommending this game if you're a strictly solo player. A lot of bosses can be very frustrating, especially because they tend to rely on spamming additional enemies which I always found to be bad design. And you can add to that the fact that the \"health potions\" in this game take way too long to use because of the animation. It's a strange game really, but still one I would recommend to people who enjoy co-op looter shooters with Souls elements. Yaesha was easily my favorite section in the game.", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "11", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
