{"cid": "UghncBMXidzm4XgCoAEC", "text": "Xenogears=my favorite game of all time\nAt first some plot elements are thrown to the player in a confusing way,  but it all makes sense in the end. Xenogears is a story spanning several millennia that involves four different incarnations of the Contact and the Antitype, heroes that actually have flaws and feel human, heartwrenching drama scenes, villains that are just heroes in disguise, visuals that most people criticize but I like more than those of FF7, an absolutely awesome OST, lots of character development not only for Fei, but also for other important characters like Elly, Citan, Bart and even the \"big bads\" Ramsus, Grahf and Krelian and a heartwrenching ending which is neither happy nor sad (Fei saved Elly and the world, but the destruction of the Zohar prevented Gears and technology from working, so the world is now in a state almost as bleak as how it would have been if Deus had succeeded in absorbing all humans), and I wish that Square Enix made a Xenogears HD remaster for the PS4 with a new battle system, improved visuals and all the cut content being an actual part of the game instead of being explained to us in a 30-minute cutscene or completely omitted, even at the cost of having three discs (The El-Regrs for example: I loved Elly so much and I wish I could play as her in her Omnigear)!\nI'm so sad Italian JRPG fans have never seen this masterpiece of a game coming to their country and I wish Square Enix could make another story like this one for FF16, or perhaps rename FF16 the Xenogears HD remaster so that Italian FF fans may play it.
