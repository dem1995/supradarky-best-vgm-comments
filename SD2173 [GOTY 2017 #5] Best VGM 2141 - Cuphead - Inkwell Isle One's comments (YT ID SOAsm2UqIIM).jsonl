{"cid": "Ugz_jO3gfULHvfFROG14AaABAg", "text": "I like how the song builds in the last third of the piece. It's slowly building a more moving melody and driving itself somewhere, and then finally burst on to the scene with a flash of excitement and showmanship. It's almost as if the musicians lay about the world, lazily playing the notes as they have countless times before. They slowly start realizing that the heroes are hanging around a little longer than usual, and so they start jazzing up their sound. By the end, they have burst out in jubilee, grateful someone decided to finally sit down, smell the roses, and drink in the sounds like a rare drink of scotch during Prohibition. \n\nAn excellent track, per usual. I sure do love music that moves. Really need to get around to playing this...

Honestly, it has some of the best presentation of any video game, ever. The 1930s cartoon visuals and audio are so well done that I would often gladly let it distract me in my quest to beat the challenging bosses. These boss fights make up most of the game and each feel unique, challenging and memorable. It honestly puts to shame the majority of boss fights in other games. This is an excellent game that I see myself replaying many times.
