{"cid": "UghujeKGIRTNxXgCoAEC", "text": "And here's my favorite game of 2016. For some reason, HLD didn't immediately click with me when I first played, but as I started understanding the game's structure and gameplay elements, it did click and in a big way. Fast paced and challenging combat, Zelda-inspired exploration, Fez-inspired presentation, perfect length. The game especially shines with all of its secrets which lead me to 100% it, and realizing the cues the game gave me all this time to find these secrets really blew me away, exploring everything again with new eyes. As a huge fan of Zelda and Fez, this game was right up my alley. The pixel graphics are amazing and Disasterpeace is a master in creating atmospheric tunes. One small fault I would give would be related to the combat system where it can sometimes feel too frantic, leading to some frustrating deaths. Overall, an absolutely recommended adventure. As for 2016 as a whole, I feel like it was a weak year for video games that is already surpassed by the first 3 months of 2017 (and looking at the reviews, Zelda BOTW is in the GOAT territory). So many games, so little free time!", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "37", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
