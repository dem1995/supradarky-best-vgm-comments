{"cid": "UgyK58OskMy81VdK8Gp4AaABAg", "text": "I don't remember the last time a game made me smile this much. It's something a lot of people say and I can only restate it myself: you cannot imagine how well VR works until you try it yourself. And if someone asked me which game to try, I would say Astro Bot without hesitation. The game itself is already a fun 3D platformer and that's all you can see from watching videos, but when you put that headset on it becomes an experience. This game has a huge variety of levels and I've rarely been so excited to discover what unique setting I would find myself in during the next stage. There are too many memorable moments to list them here, but the one where you hop on a platform that brings you under the sea with this music kicking in was almost an emotional experience. I'm extremely excited for the future of VR.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "33", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
