I got back to back stars and zoomed up to 3rd going up that final large spiral and my final item pickup on the ramp was a triple green shell, better then nothing I held onto it until I could see the other two drivers DK and Wario and only metres from the line i fire tilt fire and nail both of them who start tumbling and stall literally on the line while I zoom past them and won!!!

In the 90's they moved on to PC (or DOS as it was called back then) to play Wolfenstein 3D. NES brought some gamers in but almost 9 million user base in EU is pretty shy when North America stands for over 30 million. People rather played football games on Amiga than playing on NES in the 80's and those games who topped the chartlist were mostly C64 and Amiga games. It wasn't until SEGA came out with Mega Drive and when NES started to get some gems from third party developers the video game era started to bloom in EU. After SNES came out it got the same install base as NES had and Mega Drive expanded the demography for gamers in UK. However, you said SONY didn't revived the industry but they revolutionized the industry and expand the interest for video games. More girl gamers started to flock to PlayStation. It was about the simplistic concept and let everyone to play that sold the system. We will probably never see a variety of genres again like we saw on PS1. There were 2D games and 3D games on retailer disc. PS1 was the first CD based console to succed on the market after failures like SEGA CD, 3DO and PC Engine. Going from 68 million worldwide to 102 million worldwide is to expand the demography, right? PS1 was also the first video games console to revive the industry in EU. They brought many PC gamers into that console who saw the games and bought the system especially adults in the early of it's lifespan like '95 and '96 when we teenagers and kids got it for Xmas in '97 when PS1 really took off. PS1 managed to sell 42 million in EU in it's lifetime and that broke the sales record. The first console in history to hit 5 million mark in UK. PS2 would have sold 102 million units if it wasn't for Phil Harrison's casual route with London Studio who expand the user base to 155 million and brought casual gamers in which Nintendo grabbed with the Wii.
