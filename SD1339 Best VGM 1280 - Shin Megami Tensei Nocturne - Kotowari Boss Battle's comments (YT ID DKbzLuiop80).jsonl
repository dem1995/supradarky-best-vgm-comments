It wasn't too hard to get used to the mechanics.\n\nI got to matador and he kicked my ass, decided to put on my null:force magatama and killed him on the second try, at level 21. He killed all my other demons (i had enough time to buff Demi-fiend) and then kept spamming mazan. I kept spamming my normal attacks with like 30% hit rate and won somehow. Lesson learned: A.I sucks on Nocturne sometimes.\n\nHaven't finished the game but this far has been quite an experience. The lack of voice acting works surprisingly well. Definitely one of the best JRPGs I've played in the last 4 years.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "theDerman", "channel": "UCVUOxChbwPfQVRl77ihs-aw", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzK00OlD0Xe_4NTnqmWc8iOxmGDxWWuipchrxFV=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
