{"cid": "UgxRlDo5X2THMt_ezw54AaABAg", "text": "I had no idea this game existed until a few weeks before its release. It's been getting stellar reviews so I'll surely be playing it. It seems to draw inspiration from Planescape Torment while also doing its own thing, I've always liked a good detective game. The writing and the world building seem especially well realised, with tons of replay value depending on the choices in skills you make. This theme is super pleasant, makes me feel like a Sunday morning.", "time": "8 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "32", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
