{"cid": "UgiTf-j0XUFis3gCoAEC", "text": "The game's Earthbound visuals made me check it out and I eventually finished it, but it ended up being quite average and unmemorable. The difficulty was unbalanced, the story showed promise but never really took off and even the the great Jake Kaufman produced an \"OK\" soundtrack, except for a couple highlights like this one and Whisker Woods. I believe they are working on the sequel so I'm curious to see where they go from here.", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "13", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
