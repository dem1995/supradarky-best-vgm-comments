I never thought his sickness was life threatening, which is why it really came out of left field. Reminiscing all his accomplishments as a programmer and a president, he really was a true professional and visionary. However, what really stood out was the human being and his contagiously kind personality that would always shine like an aura. I've read many great stories about Iwata today from people who met him and it's making it all even harder to suddenly remember that he's no longer with us. This theme from Earthbound has always been one of the most emotional ones so I thought it was fitting, especially since Iwata came in in the middle of development hell and pretty much programmed this game from scratch to save it.
