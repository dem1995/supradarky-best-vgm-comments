{"cid": "UghLtlxHOog2pHgCoAEC", "text": "Just like with Brothers, I started playing this game with the keyboard (about 2 hours) and it was more frustrating than anything, knowing I couldn't fully play around with the intended gameplay mechanics. The moment I started playing with a controller, everything clicked and I just couldn't stop. I'm not even a fan of the whole luchador setting and graphics, but the gameplay and the level design are so good the rest didn't matter. The combo system with its throwing mechanic + the switching between the living and dead world + the challenging but fair platforming sections = recipe for pure fun. It's also very good at making you feel very powerful by the end of the game, something I always appreciate in a metroidvania.
