Wow, I must be pretty young.\" \nThis game had its flaws, but I liked it as a kid. It wasn't too gripping, and even now I'm struggling trying to get through the 6th world (first time) because I keep quitting in the middle. But by its concept, it isn't worse than its prequels, its just different, and that's probably the main reason why people hate it. Of course, I've never played the prequels, and from the little I've seen of TTYD, it's incredibly more creative, so my opinion is just an untested theory. The story of SPM was pretty good, too. ", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Jirt", "channel": "UCE-dsUNjcD8hQyiyxfvu2mg", "votes": "6", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJylkHX8alswF9JDpe2_b5XHqDtkCupgpiqB3wI7=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
