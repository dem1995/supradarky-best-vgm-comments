{"cid": "Ugg3p-DZWtrfCngCoAEC", "text": "I played through this game a couple weeks ago after getting recommendations on Steam and seeing its positive reviews. I had no idea what I was getting into and it took me by complete surprise. Humoristic with some very dark themes, this isn't a happy game (the title should have given me enough of a hint), but it's absolutely a breath of fresh air. The simple graphics are enough to convey details and emotions, while the hybrid gameplay of platforming and turn based RPG provides hours of entertainment. The Earthbound influence is obvious and sometimes I'd be reminded of another indie RPG, OFF. Awesome soundtrack to boot!
