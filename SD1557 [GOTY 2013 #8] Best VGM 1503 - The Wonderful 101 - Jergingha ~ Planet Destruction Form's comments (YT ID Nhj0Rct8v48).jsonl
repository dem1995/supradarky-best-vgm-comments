The Wii U letterboxes everything (which is fine), and that obviously makes everything much smaller, but in some games/demos text is so tiny that I wonder how it would even be readable on a full-size HDTV! I really have to try hard to read it. I never saw a problem with big text in video games. The only downside is that it takes more room, but in most cases that doesn't even interfere with anything!\n\nThe concept behind it (the gamepad) is awesome and I can only hope that it will become more common in gaming, and the technical achievement of sending real-time images wirelessly so flawlessly is unbelievably awesome. But, then you get to software. It blew my mind how the Wii U's menu is actually less useful than the 3DS's. Specifically, you can't check a game's manual without opening it (which takes a shitton of time). You can't create folders (organization!).\n\nRecently I also bought Super Metroid on the eShop. The game is WINDOWBOXED on my TV! That means that it is surrounded by black frames in all directions, instead of filling out my 4:3 screen entirely. To make matters worse, I contacted Nintendo (UK) and they said there was nothing wrong with the console, and that I need to check my TV's settings! There are none, by the way. It's old. It shows what it's given to show. It is DEFINITELY the console.\n\nYou know how I know? Because Wii Menu fills my screen. It HAS to be half-assed software.\n\nLastly, Nintendo Land. Please, can you create a more annoying \"voice\"? The minigames are, admittedly, pretty good for the most part.\n\n\nThe important thing, though, is the games. After a game is running, I have nothing to complain about (assuming the text isn't too tiny). So far the only REAL game I have is Wind Waker HD, and well, it's great! I expect the Wii U to have quite a bunch of great games coming up, and I even have my eye on a few existing games (including Pikmin 3 and TW101). And of course, it's the games that sell the console in the end. But when you have to battle with the system to actually play the games, I can't recommend the console.\n\n/rant.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "NeatNit", "channel": "UCjM2OgFmEWzL_6Yvef7I4fA", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyZvk_zayh9RHprZPC20P5s3IC_B9Fh1uVpnM7C=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

No bullshit DLC, unmanageable hardware issues or high prices. The golden age of gaming has been and gone, so just enjoy games from that age while they're still affordable on ebay! (P.S. I don't recommend using the Virtual Console in Europe unless you are sure the game runs in full screen 60Hz. That may be the cause of your problem, NeatNit).", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "YummyBananaFish", "channel": "UCdMDpJmEgyYGUs_1gh8JpYw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxnoTfqnQRiR2xyYx2auwBFZotw4eCVAWST5Fhj=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

{"cid": "UggiqaQH1CUzd3gCoAEC", "text": "I don't have a Wii U, but a friend lent me his so I could play this game, telling me it was awesome. And awesome it was. I was actually intimidated by this game before I played it, reading about how the battle system is very deep and complex and how it takes a long time before being able to master it. At first I felt like I was just mashing buttons, hoping to pull off good enough moves to win, but the difficulty ramps up to the point where you have to keep getting better. I was really motivated to check out tips and videos on the internet so I could improve. The gameplay absolutely shines once it all clicks (until then, it can get frustrating), the visuals and soundtrack are awesome and you're constantly hit with innovative levels and bosses.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "33", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
