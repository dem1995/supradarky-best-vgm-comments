The gameplay is so different it's kind of funny to try to compare them. There is alot going for it but most of it didn't seem refined. It starts out fairly difficult and then you just seem to level too quickly making the game very easy. The worst part for me was that they made Guy out to be an idiot and would constantly crack jokes about it. Anyway it was a fun 10ish hours of gameplay.
