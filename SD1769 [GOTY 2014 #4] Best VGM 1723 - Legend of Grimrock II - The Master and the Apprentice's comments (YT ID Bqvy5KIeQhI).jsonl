Suffice to say I'm a big fan of this series which brings old school RPG gameplay in a refreshing way. I love how they went with an open world filled with dungeons instead of one giant dungeon, a much appreciated step up from the prequel. I still think the battle system could be better implemented, but the atmosphere and puzzles are top notch. One particular sequence in a desert was especially memorable, I'm sure those who played it know what I'm refering to!", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "9", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
