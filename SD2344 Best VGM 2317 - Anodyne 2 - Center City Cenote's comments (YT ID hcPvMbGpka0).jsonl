{"cid": "UgxtUWD-UHa_XovUXB14AaABAg", "text": "I posted a couple tracks from the first game, a great little game reminiscent of Link's Awakening but still with a uniquely dreamy flavor. I just had to buy Anodyne 2 the moment I saw it on Steam and I'm happy to report that so far, the game exceeds my expectations. The mix of beautiful PS1-3D graphics (only given justice by playing the game) and 2D dungeons keeps things fresh. I also have to mention the soundtrack that instantly gives me Anodyne vibes, which means they have effectively created a franchise that has its own unique feel. This theme was an instant favorite and shows Sean really evolved as a composer when compared to the great but very short Anodyne tracks. The subtle sound of the crashing waves or the high synths starting at 3:00 are great touches that show that extra effort in the soundtrack.", "time": "11 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "53", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
