Glad I own it on my 3DS thanks to the ambassador program.\n\nOh wait! I just remembered another problem I had with this game! The mirror shield should not be obtained after you finish the game. It's pointless to get it then when you're done with the game.

The first being the empty village.\n\nAt the start of the game, all the energy is crazy, festivals, fun fun times, and even throughout the game, people are out and about, as it should be. But if everyone is stuck inside at the end of the game, wouldn't that make sense? Because somethings gone wrong at Hyrule, and whether it was cause the guards or because of fear, they needed to be inside to be 'Safe', right? The last time I played this game was a few years ago, so please forgive my fuzzy memory XD It just seems like an element that they'd stick in the game because it makes sense :D Like, at the start of the game, everything is fine, but by the end, the dynamics shifted, and it feels emptier and more serious, and that you gotta protect these people from the danger that's about to befall Hyrule!\n\nThe mirror shield thing, this is more of a question. Do you really get it that late in to the game? I coulda swore you got it a bit earlier. Like, do you get it in the very last Dungeon? At the castle? If so.... yeah, that's a little dumb XD But I thought you got it earlier then that?
