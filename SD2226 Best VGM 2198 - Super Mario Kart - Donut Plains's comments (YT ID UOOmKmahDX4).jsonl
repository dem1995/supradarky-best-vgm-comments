I'm sure you have some random, lesser known jingle or tune that the \"majority\" of people would dislike but since you had a good association or memory with it, you like it yourself.\n\nIf I took 10,000 people born between 1990-1995 in the United States that have a gaming background and put up a survey for the top 10,000 music tunes, I guarantee this would be in that 10,000. Watch yourself when you blindly say stuff like \"You know that this tune wouldnt even rank in a top 10,000 list. \" without any grounding - and don't BS me with saying \"oh you set a limit or boundary so it doesn't count.\" because YOU didn't set a boundary when you boasted \"blah blah no one ever will rate this in the top 10,000 blah blah\". \n\nThe most amazing part is that out of the thousands of videos SupraDarky has uploaded, you think it's justified to say \"this tune is bad and everyone should think it's bad\" and not expect any backlash like this. \n\nYou wouldn't go to a Trump Support Rally with a picket that says Trump Is An Imbecile And You're All Wrong without expecting some backlash right? Same idea.\n\nYour opinion doesn't represent the grand scale in any way and the fact that you open your mouth spewing that you know THIS ONE THING GUARANTEED NO QUESTION BECAUSE EVERYONE THINKS LIKE ME AND I'M SOOOO RIGHT, it only shows that your thinking capacity is on the other spectrum of that very scale.
