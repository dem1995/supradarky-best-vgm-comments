{"cid": "UgjDu2B8P5saUXgCoAEC", "text": "And so begins my top 10 games of 2013. This 3 hours game presents no challenge and barely has any gameplay apart from running around and a card mini-game that plays just like rock-paper-scissors. You're a small boy in a small town in the 1970s where giant monsters and superheroes appear every Friday. In Japan those TV shows where you have battles between giant monsters and superheroes are called Tokusatsu (think Godzilla, Ultraman, Power Rangers, etc.). You see everything in the eyes of the children and I couldn't help but be warmed by the whole game.\n\nEven if it's available for a couple dollars on the eShop, I have to say that I can't recommend it to everyone because of its lack of gameplay and its weird (and probably boring to a lot of people) story. The lyrics in this song are a good indication of the very innocent, childish tone the game has. I personally enjoyed it as it managed to give me nostalgia for a time and place I never went. It helps that I generally love japanese culture, it's part of the reason why I'm such a huge fan of the Shenmue series.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "25", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

There is exactly one voice actress / singer for the entire game, and she doesn't even do different voices. The card battles are a bit of fun, but are more like a puzzle game than anything else. Reminds me a bit of Minesweeper, which I play all the time.\n\nOverall, it's a nice game, but as you said I can't recommend it to everybody.
