The game is still on too, I can see Link standing around in Skyloft if I turn my head to the left. So yeah, I've been on an almost complete media blackout for this game so it's exciting. I went with Skyloft since that's where I'm at and I already really like it (sounds like a mix of Wind Waker and Animal Crossing). I'm sure I'll like a lot more tracks that will end up in this list.", "time": "8 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
