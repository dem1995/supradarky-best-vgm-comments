I remember having Ness and Jeff dead and just spamming pray over and over until I got the one that revived everything. It was a GOD SEND. I remember screaming I was so happy. I finally realized that I needed the Fly Honey and used it, but I was still really far behind. By the end of the fight, both Paula and Jeff were dead, and Ness was on, like, 15 HP. Ness got hit by one of the Mini Barfs, but I managed to get a super lucky crit on Belch which managed to finish him off right before Ness's HP finished scrolling down.
