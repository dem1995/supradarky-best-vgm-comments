{"cid": "UgyC3mALMb2qsDoldW54AaABAg", "text": "When I started playing this game in early 2017, never would I have thought with the plethora of amazing games incoming that this would end up being my favorite of the year. This is a special game and I'm not sure I can put into words how amazing I find it. In terms of visuals, you really have to play it to appreciate the art style and the astounding amount of details each room provides. The music is my favorite of the year. Both the visuals and music help craft a unique and memorable atmosphere for each area. The gameplay starts slow, but gets better and better as you gain more powers and freedom of control. The enemies variety is astounding and the boss battles are challenging, fun and satisfying. The map is huge and the feeling I would get when discovring new, complete areas behind seemingly small access points would often blow my mind, something only Dark Souls provided me before. It really feels like the developers created a deep, heavy lore with this insect world and this is what made me lose myself in it. From the lone surface village of Dirtmouth to the beautiful Greenpath, to the disturbingly dark Deepnest, to the otherwordly Kingdom Edge... truly, Hollow Knight is a game dense with amazing content (I clocked at 26 hours before DLC). Metroidvanias are one of my favorite genres, and Dark Souls is one of my favorite games. Hollow Knight is a mix of both. I started enjoying the game and by the time I finished it, I knew it would be in my Top 3 of the year. What I didn't expect however, after reflecting on it, is to have Hollow Knight as one of my favorite games of all time.

So say you have the Cello assigned then when the fight picks up in pace or that character does something awesome then it'll switch to that version of the track. It's really neat.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Ravenhawk19", "channel": "UC6FxzlHli1BZADUysi8pONw", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyrPboa_pmYcv3MLQdtTegXjbvV06qQjGzwLA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

I had this game sitting on my steam library for some time, and decided to finally give it a try. After some time playing, I came to search if you had posted any track here and I missed, but found out that there was none. I knew that this was a game you would love, with an amazing soundtrack and many elements from your favorite games. So I tried to contact you on facebook, but turns out that you didn't receive / read my message. When you posted Zelda on GotY #2 yesterday, I thought to myself: \"could it be?\"; but then dismissed as a silly thought. Despite that, here it is on first place! What a surprise! I knew you'd like this game, I absolutely loved it (and I'm craving more content). Team Cherry deserves more love, and I expect they'll keep on the quality on future releases. Anyway, thanks for all these years of Best VGM, it has been such an enjoyable and nostalgic ride!
