{"cid": "UgjTX7LGRcNTS3gCoAEC", "text": "You can't truly appreciate Thumper's sound design outside of the game, especially without having experienced it. To me, Thumper is a nearly perfected rhythm game akin to others in the genre like Rez. The menacing, intense and repetitive beats absolutely accentuate the experience and helps you get in a trance I've rarely had while playing a game. And if you want to complete the very fast paced levels, that trance helps you focus and is almost necessary. At some points, I felt like my hands were moving the beetle automatically in the right directions. With each level being quite lengthy, I had to take breaks after each because my brain had enough. While the number of levels and their length are very welcome, I found the variety in gameplay elements and aesthetics to be lacking between each stage. I certainly think a sequel could revisit the concept and expand on its ideas. Overall, while I haven't played that many rythm games, I would certainly put it near the top of my favorites in the genre. I'm looking forward to playing it again with VR,", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "21", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
