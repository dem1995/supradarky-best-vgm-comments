{"cid": "Ugyad-mcERO8Pr95jtR4AaABAg", "text": "Since my last upload early this year, it has been confirmed that the game will be rebranded to ensure it is released without any copyright problems, which makes complete sense. They probably first intended to have story elements directly related to the Mother series, so we'll have to forget about that. It also means that any music based on Mother themes will be removed, like this one. In the end, I'm glad they're doing this because I feel like we will be able to judge the game based on what it is instead of what it should have been as an unofficial sequel to such a beloved series.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "51", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
