There are only two missteps gameplay wise IMO\n\n1: Removal of defensive stat. Makes everyone do huge damage and ultimately brings the game a bit closer to brute force then the smart and tactical party configurations of Nocturne\n\n2: Being able to save anywhere in a dungeon. Might make some people feel less frustrated, but for me it takes a lot of the tension and excitement out of the dungeons.\n\nStill a must play though.
