I heard it's very hard and that's exactly what I want from Celeste because it usually knows how to be challenging in a fair way. I often say how the importance of atmosphere in video games is criminally underrated. At its core, Celeste is a near-perfect challenging platformer with great gameplay mechanics, but the atmosphere (which is also rooted in the music and story) is for me what set it apart.", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "43", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

Such a tight platformer, amazing story that hits you hard if you've been through something similar (I did back in 2018).

I'll never forget that part where you fall down the mountain and then at the end of the game Celeste mentions that she needed exactly that, sometimes you just have to hit deep (life in this case) to realize you have to make adjustments to the current life you are living and be \"reborn\" as the best version of yourself.
