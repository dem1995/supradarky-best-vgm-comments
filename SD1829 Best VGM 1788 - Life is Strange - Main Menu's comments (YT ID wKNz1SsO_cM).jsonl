{"cid": "UghsCO9NzXxVmXgCoAEC", "text": "I downloaded this song the day you uploaded it, and I've listened to it more than 100 times since then. Every time it came up on my playlist, I felt a sensation. I couldn't quite explain what it was then, but I can now.    Here you go: When I listen to it, I feel like in the middle of a huge mystery I can't solve. I've been trying day in and day to solve this mystery, but I haven't gotten very far, and with every step I take, it gets more and more complicated. But I'm letting all that go now. It's not going away, but I've stopped obsessing after it and let my mind wander into the beautiful natural landscape around me. My senses are heightened, and I get lost in the moment. The wind whips through my hair. The waves wash up on shore. I grow stronger with every passing moment. My strength returns to me. I don't know what lies ahead, but I'm excited for what lies ahead, and more importantly, I'm prepared to face it. But I won't face it today. Today, I'll lie back and take in the beauty of life.     In terms of the game it was written for, this is a fitting piece, and it the a perfect one to play on the main menu screen. I love it.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Joshua Fagan", "channel": "UC1Wyw1N5Gv4IPSI7vztW1Ow", "votes": "6", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJy9w3QlCFx6bD15gMCkFYUPN6oN65DH0zAgxhBZQpU=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
