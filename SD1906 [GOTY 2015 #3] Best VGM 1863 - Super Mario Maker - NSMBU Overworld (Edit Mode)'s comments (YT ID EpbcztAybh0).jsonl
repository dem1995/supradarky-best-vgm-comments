I pretty quickly decided this would be my #3, but I kept switching between my 2 favorite games of the year until I really thought about it and finally took a decision. With its near infinite potential, this is a game we will hear about for years to come, amplified by Nintendo's great ongoing support. The community's great and both modes, creating or playing the levels, are completely addicting. Even watching other people play some of these levels is entertaining. I wonder if this could be the start of a \"Maker\" series from Nintendo, exploring other franchises like the 2D Zeldas, 2D Metroids, etc. I'd certainly love it.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "19", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

And it would have to be large.\n\nMetroid is about a very large, interconnected world. It would be hard to make \"levels\" for it. It would be a different experience, at least, to have a level-based Metroid.\n\nEven Kirby has a problem: levels that are very long.\n\nI'm not saying that a Maker game for these is impossible, but it would be a lot harder to do than Mario.
