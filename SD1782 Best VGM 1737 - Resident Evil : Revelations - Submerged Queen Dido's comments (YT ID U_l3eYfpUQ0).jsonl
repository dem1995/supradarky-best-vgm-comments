I played it on the 3DS and I feel like the portable aspect really enhanced my horror experience, there's something about the screen being close to your eyes that pulls you in. The presentation was, and still is, top notch for the 3DS. I still don't know how Capcom pulled that off. This theme playing while you explore the submerged ship at the end of the game was one of my favorite experiences on a portable in a good while. Loved it.
