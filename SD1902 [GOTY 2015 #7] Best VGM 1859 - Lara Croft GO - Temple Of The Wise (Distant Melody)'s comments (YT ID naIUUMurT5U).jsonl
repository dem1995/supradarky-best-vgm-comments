{"cid": "UggxZUUccox9D3gCoAEC", "text": "I very rarely play mobile games as I'm just not that motivated to do anything else on my cellphone other than surf the web and use basic functions (I don't have a tablet yet). But when I hear especially good things about a few of these games, like The Room series for example, I do like to check them out. Lara Croft GO was also such a game and I quickly became addicted. With my headphones on and the slick visual presentation, I was immersed like rarely before on my Note 4. Most games I play on mobile never keep my interest for more than a few minutes, either because they're just too simple or the more impressive-looking games control horribly. This game has it all: the turnbased puzzles gameplay helps make the controls work as well as allowing you to sit back, relax and plan your next moves to solve them. The length is great and the challenge rewarding, especially the Cave of Fire which was a free update. The final \"boss fight\", if you could call it that, was very well done. Definitely my favorite mobile game of the year!", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "15", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
