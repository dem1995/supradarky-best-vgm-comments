In the game there must be I think 2 or 3 puzzles, and I'm trying to remember but there is absolutely ZERO puzzle in lament of innocence and curse of darkness. In addition, the puzzles of CV64 are very well thought out.\n\nThe level design of Castlevania 64 is just great and is 1000 times better than your empty corridors.\n\n\n\nthe controls are not bad at all, you must get used to and then you can really have fun and it's like that with ANY game on the planet. It is sure that when you're used to always play the same metroidvania with controls unchanged, necessarily IGAfanboy don't like it.\n\nAwful framerate? The game only slows when there is a lot of enemies on the screen (but this happens only in the first level) or when there is a lot of flames on screen. I agree the frame rate is not perfect but the game is perfectly playable.\n\nLooks ugly? the game is just beautiful and the art direction is a lot better than LOI and COD.

I was looking to side with you when you were trying to defend 64, all while you were putting Symphony of the Night In it's place, but after seeing your shit, I changed my mind. Seriously? Too Manga to bear the name Castlevania, what Bullshit. I actually like my Castlevania with a little Anime in it, thanks.

I have a theory as to why it has so many haters: It's the same as Nickelback, most people hate on it because everybody else does, when in reality they never even played it. As for the game itself, it may be different from its predecessors, but that does not mean it's bad. The atmosphere is incredible, the gameplay is solid (I never understood why people complain about the controls/camera, I didn't have any trouble with them even when I first played the game) the soundtrack is a masterpiece, the sound design is probably the best on the N64, the scenery/levels are very well designed and feel massive, the graphics are quite good for N64 and the story isn't anything special, but it's there, and has more depth to it and its characters than in most other Castlevania games. That said, there are some flaws. The one that bothers me is that the levels are laid out like an open/semi-open world game (how you can backtrack and all that) but the game is completely linear. If it was at least semi-linear, it probably would've been pretty interesting. Also, I find it a very easy game, even on the Hard difficulty, but that's probably because I beat it about 3 million times.", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "GSV", "channel": "UCEVEQZcsbomvpF-mm3y41Xw", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxtxY0f9lCrVm-jo_boPTTfSz6Hxw_n7RLCVGmi=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
