I was actually sweating by the end since you have to flail your arms to run. It felt like I was playing a racing game mixed with Mirror's Edge parkour gameplay. The soundtrack by Spencer Kitagawa is top notch, he's definitely on my radar now. This track in particular is awesome and addictive, I first let it play in the background and after a while realized I was really enjoying the mood it creates.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "16", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
