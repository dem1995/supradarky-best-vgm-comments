However, the drastic changes to the Paper Mario formula, most notable the omission of an EXP / level system as well as companions, were deal-breakers for me. I did still 100% it, but my least favorite nonetheless. If you own a 3DS I would suggest borrowing it from a friend to maximize the value from the cart.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Kinaldio", "channel": "UCdhcgW5crPRy-uqfiE9oe1w", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz1JfvlugIg-VAeWePwfWkEdoAE3BNX3e3qysm3=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

I think that people should be able to appreciate more games for what they are. All the time people just compare games, as if they need another experience to tether it to, something like a pedestal in which to hold up other experiences as if all experiences have to be the same thing. Sometimes it's an obvious stretch like, how is zelda compared to the last of us? Or, man I love pokemon red, i hate pokemon daimond or something silly. So I don't think you should be disappointed in saying that. I think you should own up to that you enjoyed it, and that you appreciate it for what it was, and at the same time, what it wasn't. Ya know? Just my 2 cents of course lol", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "LordRoto", "channel": "UC3GC21cieD0o1Z61Z1gw02g", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJx9J_wG_zja0Grl5zxKk-TKddRwq-oZ8TIv85_C=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

Like I said in my reply to ZeroKaiser, it's just my 2 cents. I don't care if you agree with me or not it doesn't make a difference. For you, for your special case. I think you are silly, because you were \"surprised to see so many people who actually enjoyed the game\" and had varying opinions than yourself. I merely thought that something that closed minded was so humorous that I laughed. so I called you silly :3 Now, i'll reiterate, I don't care that you hated sticker star, everyone's opinions differ that's life of course. My comment to you was merely reflecting your surprise at other people who did.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "LordRoto", "channel": "UC3GC21cieD0o1Z61Z1gw02g", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJx9J_wG_zja0Grl5zxKk-TKddRwq-oZ8TIv85_C=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
