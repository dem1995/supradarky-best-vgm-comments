{"cid": "UgjQW6D7Q-WyuXgCoAEC.8AbxB5NG75-8OQK7h8_lKn", "text": "I played through this game a few weeks ago and its story and characters are stellar.. to say the least. Its gameplay got really monotone, and even more so when in a gear (not the minigame). Though I don't care so much about monotone battle systems in older jrpgs since I usually play them for the story. \n\nHowever, I found its level design to be quite bad tbh. A dungeon was too many times just a cluster of straight corridors and I still wonder what sick f*** would mix turn based battles with platforming. I've never fallen so many times off a cliff just because a battle is about to start which makes me unable to jump for 0.3 seconds or so. AAAaaarrrggh rage... I just needed to get that out from my system.\n\nMy experience with Xenogears was a rollercoster of feelings. It feels like half of the time I didn't enjoy it because I was exploring one of its badly designed dungeons, and the other half of the time I enjoyed reading its well written dialogue as well as experiencing its beautiful yet complex story. Xenogear's characters, dialogue and story are so good that it saves the game from being bad. It probably makes the game really good despite what I would call bad level design.\n\nSorry for sharing my negativity of this game, but although I find some parts lacking, it's a good game.

As someone who loves Yasunori Mitsuda's work, you'd think I'd pick up on the similarities more easily (well... at the very least, I can pick up similarities between songs in Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross, but... well... it's not surprising to find similarities).\n\nAnyway, back to Xenogears: I remember trying to play Xenogears (only got to the prison complex in Disc 1 and stopped, as I felt like the game came to a screeching halt in terms of pacing), but I remember running around in the Yggdrasil. Just seeing your character as a tiny speck running around in the Yggdrasil while you can see the Gears towering over everyone.
