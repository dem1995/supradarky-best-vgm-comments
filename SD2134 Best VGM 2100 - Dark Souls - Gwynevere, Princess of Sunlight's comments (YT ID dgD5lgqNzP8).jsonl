It was the last area of DS1 and what a way to end off. The kiln that holds the first flame is reduced to this pile of ash with a weak little flame burning in the center. You finally meet the legendary Gwyn. He has gotten weak, so weak he does not even compare to many of the challenges you faced to get to him. When you kill him you're faced with 2 options and the game ends. Nothing short of beautiful story telling through visuals.\n\n3. Its a tie between Knight Artorias and Lady Maria of the Astral Clock Tower (Bloodborne) I'm going to go with Maria because I've talked about DS1 too much. Lady Maria is a very fast paced fight. There isn't a second when you aren't on you toes. Throughout her fight her moveset doesn't change a whole lot. She only gets a little more damage and range. Meaning you can keep the same strategies for getting around her without much adjustment.Don't take that to mean she's easy though. She can destroy you if you screw up. Overall a very fun boss.\n\n4.

{"cid": "Ugx1jLKz7FeNX7JqAPt4AaABAg", "text": "I can't answer anything this time only because I'm not quite as into the gameplay on these. I'd probably be kinder except the nonstop praise and refusal to accept problems from some kind of turned me off the series.\nWith that said though, I was able to jump into Bloodborne due to that one not having a massive backing at the floodgates(though it didn't take long)and I had an absolute blast. It might also be that Souls is more about slow, methodical combat, Bloodborne is high speed aggression and getting up in everyone's face which is how I like to play games(though yes in most games this gets me killed a lot...shooters especially, it's not a good idea to run face first into your opponents though kamikaze style can terrify people if they don't kill you right away).\nI'm also probably different from most gamers in that I don't care for difficulty for difficulties' sake. I usually enjoy games for story(not lore, there is a difference)and I know the argument is to go read a book but one is reading about an adventure while the other is being involved in the adventure you ARE the adventure. But I can't experience that if the game is more interested in kicking me between the legs repeatedly. These are games mainly made for those who like atmosphere(I do love their atmosphere)and hardcore gameplay(used to be into this but as I get older and want my games to be more relaxing this aspect turns me off).\nWith all that said, I do recognize it's simply a case of these games are not for me is all, and while I don't think they're as perfect as everyone says I do think they are still modern day gaming masterpieces that if I ever do manage to have the time I'll probably at least play Dark Souls.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Arc13", "channel": "UCRnY0rfgSJss0ObBuQciNEA", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwEHbUhQ-89rVBAtMDkWRiBH21XbJHnST8Zm6SF=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

Still haven't beaten Demon's or the dlc areas for DS2 and BB. \n\nI truly had burnt out from the series after having beaten BB. I couldn't muster a lick of excitement for DS3 leading up to its release, but now that I'm back, I love it so far - 20 hrs in.\n\nFave game is hard, it's between DS1 and BB. It's probably DS1, but sometimes I just get that itch for BB's speed.\n\nArea? This one's real tough. I honestly have no idea. Same with bosses, tho I really need to play the DLC of BB as I hear great things.\n\nDo I praise the sun?
