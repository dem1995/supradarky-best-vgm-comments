{"cid": "UgzoSmIgDie0pLiLdzt4AaABAg", "text": "There's something about this game that just hit all the right notes as a huge fan of IGA's Castlevania games. Timespinner is the definition of \"if it's not broken, don't fix it\". It doesn't try to hide and be anything else than a clone of these games. The menus, the familiars, the various weapon types including the classic overhead giant swords/maces, the corridors transitioning between areas, the UI, the rare drops and even the music. That soundtrack by Jeff Ball might be my favorite of the year and I would never blink an eye if I was told it was composed by Michiru Yamane. It doesn't reinvent the wheel and the time mechanic itself is underused, but this was exactly what I wanted when I purchased this comfort food game.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "29", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

Picking this up the moment I can.\n\nOn a side note I saw an old comment I made on one of your videos five years ago, about picking up Earthbound. It took uh, five years, but I finally did it! There's no game quite like it, and I'm intrigued by how nostalgic it made me feel despite never having played it before. Might even prefer it over Mother 3, including the ost, but it's hard to compare them since their strengths lie in different places. Better than Beginnings though, I played it first so I got a soft spot for it, but Earthbound was basically \"Beginnings, but better in every way\". If I had to chose some memorable songs from the series that aren't the title themes/ending themes or variations of those, I'd probably go with Yucca Desert and Onett. I got such a huge grin when I got to the desert part in Earthbound and heard the Yucca theme mixed in.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "CinnamonThief", "channel": "UCT2tDFM3MiqyWp7I20aTHNA", "votes": "13", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJw9E10MmSTqZUCb3rqwOIyFaoEPcv87n0AhA2ST=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
