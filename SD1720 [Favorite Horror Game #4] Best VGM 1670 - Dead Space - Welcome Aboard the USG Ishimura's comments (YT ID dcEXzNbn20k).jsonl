The story/characters are decent, make sure to listen to all the audio logs and shit if your into story.  Great game though so if this sounds good definitely play it!", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "xSayPleasex", "channel": "UCtU-V-Sncad2nwEwxs51uuQ", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxmGOfkaE1c4j-qaIXAz-EsQYvMhI2P1q5DBDb_=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

I barely used any of the guns that didn't have the cutting mechanic because that took away most of the fun. For me, it was all about the default Plasma Cutter and the Line Gun. It added some really nice strategy to the combat system and made it feel very satisfying after you cleaned out a room full of monsters that first felt completely overwhelming. Mixed with an upgrade system and memorable moments like the Zero-G sequences, Dead Space quickly shot up my list of favorite horror games.
