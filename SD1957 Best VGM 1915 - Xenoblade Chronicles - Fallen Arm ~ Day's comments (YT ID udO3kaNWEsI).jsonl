{"cid": "Uggf0hp4gPcK5HgCoAEC.8ETaLRbEsJ38N7ZTx6KoQO", "text": "+Matthew Etter \nMechanic wise; yes, it borrows a play style that is typically found in MMOs. However, that isn't what I was making the comparison to. The vibrant color pallet, story, and music reminds me very much of the JRPGs found in 16-bit and 32-bit era. Games like: Chrono Trigger, Thounsand Arms, and Xenogears placed a very strong emphasis on those elements. While many modern JRPGs still have amazing soundtracks, they seem to place so much more attention on their graphics.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII is the best example I can give to the night and day contrast of games between now and then. This was a game I anticipated so much for, that when I played it, it just railroad me with so many cutscenes between moving from point A - point B. I was disconnected from the experience and felt that I was passively watching a story play out in front of me, rather than being a character going on a journey.\n\nWhile the Wii doesn't have the horsepower of it's other console brethren, it made up for it in every regard where it could. It had a plot that mattered to me, a sense of wonderment that I wanted to explore and find/see everything that I could. There are areas and secrets you could miss, because the game didn't guide you to every place. Final Fantasy XV even suffers in this regard, to a small bit, where locations are marked on your map for you, and driving is so passive. So much time feels wasted as the game wants you to see itself as a cinematic wonder between travels.\n\nI believe cutscenes should be used sparingly (not to say that there can't or shouldn't be a lot in a game), and allow players to become more involved as a character. Going back to Final Fantasy XV, it does a LOT more right then it does wrong, (especially when compared to XIII) and offers a lot to explore and enjoy. I just gripe a bit that RPGs, nowadays, place more importance on flair and style, rather than substance. RPGs just seem to do a lot more with less, back in the day, when compared to today's hi-tech games/consoles. But that's just my opinion.", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "WillyML4", "channel": "UCHfmDnCOYCWxU-wsud02KDQ", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyjmU6CG-zfxQR4pK4LcyIX_ETtNOERPwMiXA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

{"cid": "UggwtOsXFDu6zXgCoAEC", "text": "Wall of text incoming:\nI finally finished this game (130 hours) yesterday. I completed mostly everything except for some Superbosses and by the end, I was happy to finally go back to the main story. The world, the music and the story were the definite highlights. The world of Bionis has to be one of my favorites in a video game; it's absolutely beautiful, unique and varied, and then you also have Mechonis and a memorable sequence in Space. I already knew the soundtrack was amazing, but playing the game and listening to the tracks in context is even better. Most of my favorites were composed by the ACE+ composers, which by the way is a travesty that they’re not being hired to compose more game soundtracks. The main story was unsurprisingly well told, cinematic and full of emotions, as is always the case with Takahashi.\nI did think Xenoblade had its list of flaws. Even if they are optional, the sidequests were forgettable and boring to complete due to their mundane MMO-type tasks (collect X or kill X). I quickly stopped reading them and just focused on their objectives. I’d rather have 10x less sidequests that are actually interesting and that help develop secondary characters or the lore. Completing them also made me overpowered against the final bosses, which made them less memorable, but that’s a recurrent problem in RPGs that is challenging to fix. The MMO feel doesn’t stop there, my biggest problem with the game was its combat system. I must have spent 40 hours out of 130 looking at the bottom of my screen, waiting for the cooldowns on my skills while my character auto attacked. I rarely felt like I had to use strategies (even before being overpowered), and while the monsters were varied in their design, they all felt the same in combat as I would just easily kill them by using all my skills. Really, the sidequests and the combat system made me feel like I was playing an offline MMO.\nThe waypoint system was a very welcome feature, allowing you to quickly teleport between landmarks, though I did feel like they were sometimes misplaced in a couple areas. The super quick loadings (and sometimes none at all) blew me away, Monolith are absolute masters in the technical department. The main story and its cast of characters were so good that I’m quite worried for the sequel and its “Create your own character”, as if the MMO feel I don’t want is taking over even more. Still, I would safely put Xenoblade in my list of top Wii games or top RPGs I played in the past 5 years.

Even though the music is quite good, it never gets out of the epic and heroic themes, that the original Xenoblade acomplishes in a better way with songs like You Will Know Our Names and Engage the Enemy; and it never gives you the moments of peace, exploration and melancholy that Xenoblade achieves with the Satorl Marsh ST, the Valak Mountain ST, Gaur Plains and others, along with the well-placed moments of silence that let you soak in everything.\n\nI don't think I have ever experienced something like the first time I got to the knee, with no music after spending so much time on the Tephra Cave and saw Mechonis, menacing and diabolical (wich makes the later plot twist so much better; its an example of how well this game tells a story whithout narrating it).

They actually do well to complement each other. Just don't go into X thinking you'll have the same experience as Chronicles, and you'll be fine. It is very good in its own right and compares more to the older Xeno- games, like Gears and Saga in terms of tone.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Jonathan Hodrick", "channel": "UCoJeAEILsLJ9f1VMGmunEsg", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJx9tpISqKLebBxiK25dC0sg8jvJl3AIUbjVfUs-Ov8=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
{"cid": "UggwtOsXFDu6zXgCoAEC.8ETSbrLOBmn8ETur5XlCTq", "text": "When you play Xenoblade X: don't expect another Xenoblade, but instead an unique experience unlike many other out there, and you won't be disappointed. Below I will tell you a little about the story and the soundtrack in XCX vs. XC. I made it spoiler free.\n\nI wouldn't say XCX has worse story than XC, it's just very different from any other games you played out there. For example: in XCX you don't play as the main character and the story is about the planet itself, compared to XC which has a very typical fantasy jrpg storyline. Since I'm not a big fan of fantasy (and since I like unique stuff I haven't encountered as often), I have to say that I was (much) more into the story in XCX. And almost all of the sidequests in XCX has something to give to its story, making the main objectives only the main objectives of the story, not the entire story in itself. Which really fits the open world formula the game features. Maybe one could say that the story in XCX is its lore, and the lore is really good.\n\nAnd when it comes to the soundtrack I would probably say that XC has an overall better soundtrack (one of my favorites), but I can't deny that XCX has much more variation. And the lyrics makes the soundtrack feel very \"fresh\". I know that some people rejects the soundtrack because it features rap, but that's just ignorant to do. For example has XCX a bit of rap in its normal fighting theme, but I still prefer that fighting theme over the one in XC since it has a slower start (almost all fighting themes in XC gets tiresome after a while). Tbh, I would probably say the fighting themes in XCX are in general better fighting themes than those in XC.\n\nAs I said, go in open minded and you will be rewarded. But if you expect another XC (with a lot of typical fantasy stuff to its story etc.) you will be very disappointed.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Eirian Odalis", "channel": "UC1aGPFAMbPS0lRf106rkEEg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxnFVPquEbxzSQusCupO6lVeKKSnrVzR1aizVqS=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
