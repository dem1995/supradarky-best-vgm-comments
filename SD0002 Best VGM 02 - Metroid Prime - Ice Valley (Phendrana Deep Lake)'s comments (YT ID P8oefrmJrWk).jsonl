Sure, it maintains a similar gameplay style to its predecessors, but it's no more repetitive in this fashion than most RPG games or sequels within a series. If you take any games of different generations, even ones with only a one generation difference, and compare the gameplay, there's hardly any repetition in them. I've found each generation has massive differences in the game experience, and while each game has mostly retained its appeal and resisted the \"aged badly\" effect, each generation has had major improvements on the previous.\n...Given, Diamond and Pearl kind of sucked, but Platinum fixed all of the major issues with that and is honestly a phenomenal game.\nI do really want to hear your opinion, though. What makes it too repetitive? I've always found that it maintains the core gameplay and functional environment to showcase it very well while changing the game enough to create fresh experiences and major differentiation.\n...Also, in anticipation of a possible \"same thing every time catch Pokemon battle gyms\" argument, there are a ridiculous amount of spin-offs that are completely different from that kind of gameplay (Ranger, Conquest, Mystery Dungeon, Rumble, etc). If you're looking for a different approach to the Pokemon series, you could always try those. In my opinion, the main series is the MAIN series for a reason, and should maintain the Pokemon series-style gameplay while the spin-off games should have the change in style that some people ask for.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Query", "channel": "UCRJN45eOxvjvO1AqHJvWPBg", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyUHWndHOER9NZRuR-vqrdPtqjUMf0vOWz3mTyD0A=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
