It was really nice to spend more time with friends and family, and I also focused on playing many 2016 games in preparation for my Top 10. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to play a lot of high profile games (Uncharted 4, Last Guardian, FFXV to name a few), but I'm still confortable with listing 10 great games I played. I also want to thank everyone for your comments in the #2000 video, this is why I do this. I read each of them and was also flooded with direct messages, and I have to say reading some of your stories related to this channel brought the biggest smile. So my reponse to all your thanks is to, well, thank you as well!", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "85", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
