{"cid": "UggYT0vZMmdXIHgCoAEC", "text": "To me, Dark Souls 2 is the best of the series for actual gameplay. Best build variety by far, largest selection of equipment/spells/miracles/pyros/hexes, dual wielding that actually works, great PVP arenas for dueling, interesting covenants with unique mechanics, bonfire ascetics for a nice bit of sequence-breaking, worthwhile NG+ with new enemies, items and surprises, large amount of NPCs white phantoms and invaders, huge amount of bosses and DLCs that slot naturally in the game (talking about SOTFS here) for a complete package that provides an insane amount of level variety and value.\n\nNot to mention that in my humble opinion, the lore was excellent once you actually got the three crowns, consulted Vendrick, talked with Aldia and obtained the true ending.\n\nAll that being said, Demon's Souls is still my favorite overall (or King's Field IV, if I want to get pedantic) and Bloodborne is my choice for most intense boss battles and soundtrack in general.

{"cid": "UggX4Gg-aOETcXgCoAEC", "text": "Seeing as Dark Souls is one my favorite games of all time, I can't really explain why it took so long for me to play this game, I just finished it. The series is quite intimidating because of how challenging it is, so that might be part of the reason, but it only takes a couple minutes of playing the game for you to get back into it and be addicted all over again. The gameplay is so rewarding, unlike anything else really. I hear a lot of people say DS2 is the worst game in the series but you know what? I absolutely loved it and thought it was very memorable, so if this is the worst the series has to offer (have yet to play DS3 and Bloodborne), then you know this is a special franchise. I did identify a couple negatives that weren't present in the first game: I thought the hitboxes were not as accurate and because of that, rolling out of the way or parrying didn't feel as on point. The interconnected world is also not as well made as the first game, but the quality and variety of each places are still top notch. The bosses were a big highlight, unsurprisingly. The 3 DLCs were also very good, with the Old Iron King having my favorite boss in Sir Alonne (accompanied by an awesome arena and music too).
