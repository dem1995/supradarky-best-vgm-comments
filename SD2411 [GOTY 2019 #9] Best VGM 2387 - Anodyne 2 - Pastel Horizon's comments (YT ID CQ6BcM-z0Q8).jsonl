{"cid": "UgxN92_g8ROxgz_8YqF4AaABAg", "text": "Anodyne 2 gave me exactly what I was looking for, a fleshed out sequel to a little gem. If I had to name one thing that makes these games so special, it's the uniquely dreamy atmosphere. I just cannot think of other games that have this specific ambience. The mix of an openworld-style hub using PS1 graphics with 2D dungeons definitely ticks nostalgia boxes, and I was very surprised to see such variety in gameplay/atmosphere between the different dungeons as you progress. Some dungeons even change the graphics style! It's all helped by an equally dreamy soundtrack. I do have to say that in terms of writing, I sometimes felt like I had to be inside the writer's brain to fully understand everything. Maybe I'm just not smart enough, I understood the overall story and where it was going but often found myself scratching my head at some of the things I was reading. In a way, it was also part of the game's charm. An overall great experience that only makes me more excited for their next game.", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "36", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
