{"cid": "Ugw9DRaRQ63dQGrDv_d4AaABAg", "text": "And here we go with my Top 15 games of 2018. Kickstarter gave us some amazing games with awesome stretch goals like Shovel Knight, but to have a stretch goal be a whole different game is something else. It's funny because I enjoyed Curse of the Moon much more than the demo I played of the main Bloodstained game. IGA is not even trying to hide the Castlevania roots here, starting with the subtitle. The game itself is a Castlevania III clone done right. It was extremely refreshing to play and there's one gameplay decision they made that actually turned out to be very nice: you can switch between any of 4 characters at the press of a button, each with their own style, but when a character dies it gives you a chance to play as the 3 remaining characters, until all characters die. This can force you to play with some characters you would not usually choose and that forces gameplay variety in a great way (unless of course you're so good you never die). I still remember holding my breath when I had to finish a stage only with the old alchemist and his super short staff. If you like the classic Castlevania games, you have no reason not to give this game a try and expect some great music by Yamane.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "36", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
