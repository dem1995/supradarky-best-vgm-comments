Around the time it was released, people were raving about how difficult the game was, and that I'd be tearing my hair out on it. Using 4-direction arrow key controls, which were said to be impossible by some people, I managed to get the game done in a few hours, one of the bosses on the first attempt. I was looking forward to much more of a challenge and was left quite disappointed.\n\n\nWhat really is a shame is how beautiful the world is. All of the bosses have really nice designs that fit perfectly with the world around them, the controls are tight and satisfying, and exploring the ruins and listening to the soundtrack is fulfilling in its own right. I just wish the game was meatier, and lived up to its \"OMG SO HARD\" reputation.

{"cid": "UghFWKhZG3XuBngCoAEC", "text": "Finished this game yesterday in 2 sittings and really loved it. I can definitely understand why some people wouldn't, though. This is basically a game made of boss rooms, interconnected through an empty, ancient world filled with enough lore to be satisfying. The pixel art is awesome and the soundtrack is mighty impressive, filled with profesionnal sounding epic and relaxing themes. The highlight is definitely the gameplay: you can run, roll to dodge and you're only equipped with a bow and 1 arrow. Shooting and aiming the arrow requires to be standing still, and afterwards you have to either move to the arrow or summon it to you (again standing still) to pick it back up. The one element that really makes this game for me is the fact that you die in 1 shot, but the titans as well. This makes for some of the most satisfying kills I've had in a long while when finally (or quickly in some cases) managing to hit a titan's weak point. Loved that!
