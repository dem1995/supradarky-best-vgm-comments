{"cid": "Ugwm6koeBBIXfgW7LPp4AaABAg", "text": "Alright, let's kick off my Top 10 for 2017! Unlike 2016 which I thought was a very weak year in gaming, 2017 was the complete opposite and one of the best... ever. So good that there are still tons of them that I have yet to play. Little Nightmare is one I played very recently and immediately left an impact on me. It's quite reminiscent to a game like INSIDE, but with a much bigger focus on horror. The sound design is great but it's the visuals that I really found incredible in how clean they are while still being able to portray a dark and gritty atmosphere. The claustrophobic nature of The Maw is also very well realized and they nailed the fact that when you're a kid, everything around you feels bigger.The gameplay really picks up when you sneak around the adult entities (I can hardly call them humans) and start understanding what is going on. A couple tense pursuits are also very well done. Short but memorable, this first original entry from the team in Sweden is hopefully just a first step to a lengthier experience.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "23", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
