Atlus put a lot of effort in the dungeons and in the overall gameplay, to make sure it won't get boring. Also, it's extremely stylized, you can see where the developers used all their time working on it. If I have to complain, then it would be its writing. Its story is not that well written. Like, it talks about sexual harrassment in the game, but later on it doesnt mind sexualizing certain characters. Also, it has 3 LGBT characters in the game, and 2 of them are insulting stereotypes. They arent for long there, and used for cheap jokes, but as a member of the LGBT community, I really had to roll with my eyes there. Otherwise, it's a pretty fine game. Personally, I prefer P3's story & atmosphere(P3 is my fav Persona), but it is a lot of fun and you dont make anything wrong, by buying and playing P5.

Especially with a Japan-made game that has managed to make it to #5 with many variations of #3 and #4. And over 4 generations of consoles! Or 3 if you discard ps3 which I think is not unfair.\n\nYes there is character sexualization but I think that's necessary. Japanese people aren't having as many kids as they should. The men AND women don't care about sex. It's almost as if the developer is trying to get locals to open up to each other. Just look at recent Japanese anime coming out and compare it to something like Lupin the Third. And it just so happens the West likes that shit to begin with, which sells.\n\nThe track itself is very soothing. I listened to it heavily when the game came out. I'm glad it made your list. \n\nMore than anything, I'm glad the list is still going on. Keep it up, dude. \n\nAtlus need all the support they get... The older the game franchise gets, the harder it becomes to retain older clientele while making sure newer ones don't jump ship.\n\nThat is why Half Life 3 will never be confirmed.

I've played of them several times, and when i finished the 3rd, i was like \"ok, this will be my favorite of the series\". And then came the 4th. And then came the 5th.\n\nIt's different. In mhy opinion, the character are all well-made, we understand their implication in the whole story, their own stories are interesting and fit in the subject of the game.\nWith the difference in strenght with the PS2, they managed to make many part of the game really strong. (thanks to cinematics, mostly.) The game is weell-written and well balanced. And of course, the ost are awesome.\n\nOf course the game's not perfect (like, some stuff at the end of the game for me), but it could easily be the best Persona for a lot of people.\nI hope i was understandable, since english isn't my frist language. Anyway, thanks for your channel, it's awesome !", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Sora3744", "channel": "UCMKFmlquKlsyrVPmbP-A1_g", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJykFRVtKfYxyIPVyZWZce__8q7QiMljvgZ7vQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

However, this is more due to P4s dungeons being designed around facing one's self. The dungeons and villains in 5 represent corruption and are meant to embody extremes, so its hard to compare P5s cast to the depth most of P4s cast got. However, If you hated Teddie (as some people did), Morganna is generally seen as having a more important plot role and far less annoying. It feels like he brings something unique to the team.\n\nAnother thing that makes it a bit different is that you are an outcast from the get go. Without going into detail, no one likes you and no one likes your friends. So you do not really get to join a bunch of clubs because people do not like you. I thought it was a fun twist on instantly being sought after by all the clubs in the previous two games.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "B K", "channel": "UChWJxTZIkGQTX7hhLnNsY8w", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz9WS7oTKi9azRofnzyYP4vEe1KteHGCWjb2g=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
