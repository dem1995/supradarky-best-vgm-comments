I uploaded the Opening theme a long while back, which is still one of the weirdest ones i've heard (and for me, in an awesome way). It's a crime this great game wasn't released here because Nintendo deemed it too strange for western audiences. Gifptia is a very unique adventure game made by Skip (known for Chibi-Robo), which is a small company that formed after Love-de-Lic disbanded. Love-de-Lic was mostly known for another great japanese exclusive game, Moon Remix RPG Adventure (which has been featured in this list) and you can definitely see similarities in style and music between both games, with Kenichi Nishi being the designer.
