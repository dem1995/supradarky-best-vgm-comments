The gameplay has two parts : one is exploration (you need to find items in the background in order to progress)and the other part is fighting monsters on a chessboard, as in final fantasy tactics. The life of the game is short, but the story is great, the characters endearing, the atmosphere spooky and respectuous of occidental culture.
