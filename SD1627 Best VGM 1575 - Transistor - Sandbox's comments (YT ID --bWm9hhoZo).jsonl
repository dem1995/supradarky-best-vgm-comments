{"cid": "Ugg40OUU2D_7NHgCoAEC", "text": "Amazing OST to an amazing game.\nI really feel it's superior to Bastion in every way, even though I absolutely loved that game. The combat really has more depth to it with \"functions\" (think of them as spells or abilities) that can be used as either passives, actives, or upgrades to other functions. And of course the art nouveau style is so gorgeous and something I've never seen in video games. I also like the way they handled defeat in this game. Having your health reduced to 0 doesn't end the game, it removes one of your functions for a few encounters which I found very interesting since it forces you to vary your playstyle. However it's still possible to die, especially if you crank up the difficulty with \"limiters\", which are handicaps of sorts, like the shrines from Bastion. All in all I can't recommend this game enough. :)", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Thomas Carollo", "channel": "UC3BlZbzO5X8tYFugEloQzgA", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyx6ocSbOD6HwzmzQhqknDZhqevLeA-35hHLK_6sg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
