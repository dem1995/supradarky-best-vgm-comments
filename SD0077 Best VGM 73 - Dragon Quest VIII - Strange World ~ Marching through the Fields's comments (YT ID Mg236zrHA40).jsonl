Instead, all of them are directly rendered. So, you can see any details of any towns without entering it. \n\nProofs if DQVIII is based on Knight & Baby/Guardian's Crusade are:\n-Anything at world map is completely not symbolized by any icons.\n-Music changes if you enter the town, except for loading screen and people appears after loading screen. K&B/GC have no loading screen when entering any towns and any people at any towns are visible even the town isn't entered.\n-You can only land at outside of any towns, except for auto landing positioning when you want to land at inside of any towns.\n-Visible enemies, only for 3DS version of DQVIII.\n-Ship can only parked at specified place.

Not to mention that you can only save in towns, so if you die, you go all the way back. This is possibly the single hardest J-RPG I've ever played and not for the right reason.

This gives it a nice nostalgic feeling to it, especially if you grew up playing 16-bit era rpgs. It gives me the same \"feeling\" games like FFIV and Lufia gave me back in the day.
