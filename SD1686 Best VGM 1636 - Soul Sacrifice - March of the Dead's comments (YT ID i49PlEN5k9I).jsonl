There's no resource collection, the boss doesn't change area (because they can't) and there's no weapon 'classes'.\n\nYou get to equip 6 spells from a pretty huge collection (ranging from melee weapons, explosives, evasion modifiers, recovery and much more) and you fight the monster in what is basically a spruced-up arena. Completing the quests nets you more spells and monster essences that are used to unlock permanent and temporary buffs.\n\nWhat it really has going for it is that its got stacks of content, a great variety of really inspired monsters, a surprisingly engaging story that's presented really well and the lore is genuinely interesting; every monster and locale has a short story about them.\n\nThey've also been supplementing the game with free updates since it was released. Since Delta's release they've added 6 monsters, a load of aesthetic options and balance changes.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Emarrel", "channel": "UCKXqcI40NlIJYAmtzaieCFA", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxXFbcdjQ8EXDFA-zYNyQLwNo9VaoylmOOGn9iz=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
