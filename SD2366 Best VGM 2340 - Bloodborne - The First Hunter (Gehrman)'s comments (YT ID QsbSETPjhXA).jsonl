{"cid": "UgyD_Ebu2DZsiSOtb1h4AaABAg", "text": "I played through this game for the first time this summer and... what an amazing game. I had recently played Dark Souls 3 and I definitely felt like my FromSoftware reflexes were on point. I needed some time to get used to having no shield and exploit the parry mechanic, so I had a lot of trouble going through the starting zone. And then, it clicked. I ended up being stuck on only a few bosses, and even those it was usually 4-5 attempts. I read a lot of people saying they find Bloodborne harder than the Dark Souls series, but it was absolutely the opposite for me (and that's fine). A lot of it comes from having so many healing vials, as well as the Rally mechanic which lets you heal per hit within 5 seconds of being hit yourself. That mechanic is so great that I now wish all games in this genre had it, because it makes combat even more intense with its risk/reward.  I actually beat Gehrman on my 2nd attempt, and then proceeded to beat Moon Presence on the first try. The Orphan of Kos was definitely a big challenge though.", "time": "9 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "34", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
