We wont have characters project elemental magic, but we will certainly have advanced spaceships. The theme of religion is very present in the game. The Eldridge almost feels like a religious/ civilization carrying spaceship. At 100 kilometers long, it is an awesome idea to include in a story. Brilliant by all means... I wish I would have been there to work on Xenogears. I would love to contribute to such amazing stories. All it needs now is a sequel, a more scientifically accurate sequel.

Classed it among my top 2 games. Then played FF:Tactics, and goddammit that game is good, I placed it even higher. Then I played Chrono Cross, and I placed it even higher. And 2 (or 3?) years ago I played Xenogears for the first time... and it instantly became my favorite game of all time! And it's unfinished. I like FF8, a LOT, but I would take Xenogears over FF8 any day, so fuck you Square for over-prioritizing FF8 and completely leaving Xenogears on the side. (I don't know what it is with older games, but any new game I play isn't better than the old games I recently play. I started FFX as well recently and it's also a fucking masterpiece, no matter what people say beacuse of Tidus who cares. And it's not because of the nostalgia factor for me, I'm just playing them right now, didn't play them when I was a kid, still better story than most recent games I don't get it)\nMy list right now is Xenogears>Chrono Cross>FF Tactis>FFVII,VI,X, Square games in general.\nSo I would prioritize a Xenogears remake over ANYTHING. Simply by reading the first few sentences when the \"book\" part of CD2 began I saw SO MUCH potential.\nLike, I have a VERY APPROXIMATE memory of it starting along the lines of \"We went through that factory. Mid-way we saw some rockets standing there and we questionned their purpose. Then we reached the end and launched the bio-[whatever it was]. Suddenly humans all over the planet started randomly turning into [those brown modified thingies].\" And I was like \"HOLD UP!!! You just skipped what could easily be more than an hour/an hour and a half of gaming in 4 sentences!!! No!!!!!!! What is happening!\" You could imagine so much through all those texts written, that they couldn't program because Square didn't leave them the time and money (come on, all that because they decided to trust FFVIII (8) =\\ Fuck you just for that Square)\nAnyway, so much potential... XG needs a remake Q.Q Too bad we probably won't have one, ever, because of rights over the game being completely discrete, or Square owning too much and the creators at Monolithe now owning nothing, or I don't even remember.\nOh but to your comment saying FFVII is shit compared to XG, I still get a bigger nostalgia overdrive from FFVII's music than from XG's, and it's still a game with a great atmosphere and lovable characters, compared to XG having its INCREDIBLE story as a main asset (and since I love story more than anything, I obviously would place XG as n°1).\nWhy am I ranting? I don't know. I'm just still amazed by the power all those old games have (I almost said \"old Square games\" but in the end the \"Square\" Square staff did more bad than good to XG xD [ok they gave the money so XG would've never existed without them, but if the making staff found another publisher/developer thingy whatever it's called then maybe......])\n[Edit : By the way I don't even remember where I take these informations from, the fact that Square was only the publisher and the main staff aren't really the ones at Square who were working on the FFs and stuff... I just remember I heard that somewhere, so I may be wrong, my research is old, it's been like 3 years now so I won't even be able to quote my sources]", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Terra Nort", "channel": "UCq7wk-URkyvudNqWzfZ73gQ", "votes": "7", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwaOsdoA-XeJtzBlI3K66i_pHTmuWubS3nUfizd=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
