SD3 lets you charge your attack bar, has spells, you have to level up your characters to fit your playstyle, ... The overall gameplay might be a matter of taste, but SD3 gives you six characters, of which you can only choose three, three overall stories, branching character classes, all of which adds replay value. \nYour point of the pacing of the game forcing you to grind was interesting. I realized that whenever I played the game I sometimes grinded for a while to change classes earlier. (Talking about SD3 now, as I have played that far mor often than 2). I started a new game and tried to not grind a single bit. I.e. walk straight from objective to objective. I did completely clear every room though, even though technically I could have walked through them. And by now, with Lise, Kevin and Duran, very offense oriented, I beat the second god beast, I'm five levels below everything, but doing fine. I've had to go back to buying Poto Oils once, but stocked up 50 or so and it was way more than enough. If this trend continues, I can safely say you don't /need/ to grind in SD3.
