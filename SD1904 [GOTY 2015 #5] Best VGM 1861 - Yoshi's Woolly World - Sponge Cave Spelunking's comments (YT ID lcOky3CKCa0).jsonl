{"cid": "UghrSuIQYmlyh3gCoAEC", "text": "Well this is a surprise. Listening to this great soundtrack made me ask a friend to lend the game to me. Not only is this easily my favorite YI since the original (which, to be honest, isn't saying much), it's one of my favorite 2D platformers I played in a while. This is a feel-good game, pure fun. My first impressions weren't that positive as I was mainly impressed by the superb visual style but wary of the lack of challenge which can make the whole package boring to play. However, as I played through the game and went for all the collectibles + gold star, I really had to do my best. The special levels can offer a great challenge as well. The game is just so pleasant to play through and the level design/mechanics can be very clever. Not anywhere near the original's \"best games ever\" territory in my book, but still very solid!", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "25", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
