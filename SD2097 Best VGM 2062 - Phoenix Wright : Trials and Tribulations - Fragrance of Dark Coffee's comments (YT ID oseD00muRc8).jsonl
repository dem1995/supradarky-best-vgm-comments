Godot succeeded at the other one in the final trial too, as well as getting revenge for Mia. I can't remember exactly why it had to be then, but it probably had something to do with that obscure plan and the possibility of him getting away from it without being fingered for murder.\nThat said, he was my favorite prosecutor to be up against because he was mostly chill even if he was demeaning Phoenix. He did his part to guide Phoenix (albeit in a tough-love kind of way) to the truth, and the only difference there was that instead of being behind the defense booth with him, he was at the other end of the court room. He was never actually on top of the case like Edgeworth and Von Karma, and investigated the case much like how Phoenix did. In court, he made sure that Phoenix backed up his bluffs with evidence rather than just letting him control the case with them.\nFinding out the truth at the end was worth it, because after a whole game of belittling and demeaning you, Godot finally showed respect and called Phoenix by his actual name.
