In the 90's,  it wasn't really common knowledge that the battery needed to be replaced on these games to allow them to hold saves. Ignorant of this, and with no other options, I bought the game for $9 and took it home. For the next 3 weeks, I played this game without turning my SNES off. It was one of the best and worst experiences of my young life. If you've ever played this game, you know how long it is and how much grinding you have to do because of the hyper-inflated difficulty of the US version.
