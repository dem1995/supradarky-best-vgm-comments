The only thing now I think D3 is lacking is its specs/loot tailoring.\n\nSimply put, because you can just change specs on the fly, and because legendary loot doesn't have the same level of specialization as it did in D2 (we basically need more variability in uniques/legendaries), you can just chuck on whatever you get and respec if needed. That will likely lead to a shorter end-game.\n\nHaving said that, what they did introduce was great. Loot 2.0 is a breath of fresh air and I really like the enchanting system, especially that it gives you two options and you can choose to keep your existing stat if things go wrong.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Random Garreh", "channel": "UC7bw2wmWwJAxZLu9n58VujA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyGUGytW7_dmrDMpcG4gKqAIdQt8VVbe8wmxLpg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
