{"cid": "Ugh2OCit87ZVr3gCoAEC", "text": "Finding good and memorable music for some of these horror games is proving difficult. Doom 3 was and remains a divisive game. While some people hated it and thought it completely strayed away from the prequels (and I can't disagree), I simply enjoyed my time with this game back when it came out. Lights turned off and headphones plugged in, I was in for some very intense and scary moments inside the Mars labs. I couldn't believe how great the graphics were and it definitely reinforced the game's horror aspect. I generally couldn't play through more than 2 levels at a time before I felt like I had to take a break. The gameplay was plain fun and I loved a mechanic that a lot of people hated : not being able to pull out your guns at the same time as the flashlight. I thought it added a very interesting layer to the exploration, never making you feel completely safe. As for the other games in this series, I'd probably put Doom 64 in my Top 15.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "17", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
