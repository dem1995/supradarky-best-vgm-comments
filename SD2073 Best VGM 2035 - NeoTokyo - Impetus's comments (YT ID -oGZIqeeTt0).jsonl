{"cid": "Ugh3wO7Xu_Z-oHgCoAEC", "text": "NeoTokyo and Shatter are the best soundtracks I've found through this list - NeoTokyo is perfect listening for a grey day. My favourite track which hasn't been uploaded yet is Scrap I/O.\n\nI also wondered if anyone noticed this or knows the reason for it: I was listening to Best VGM 2024 from Metroid AM2R, and I thought its melody was so familiar - it's almost identical to Sprawl from NeoTokyo. I didn't notice this at the time when listening to #1659. So I guess this means Sprawl and SR388 from Metroid II share similarities?", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "goomzilla", "channel": "UCtrQLD63bjAWY3KNiSCBiSA", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwTg1leqNlJ54CrN_Wh2TNVzl0ZVznlhWNK7j-KqQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
