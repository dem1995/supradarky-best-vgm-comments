{"cid": "UgybXcI5ME97a4dLHQN4AaABAg", "text": "Another one of the very few Super FX games that existed on the SNES. Dirt Trax FX was nowhere near as popular as Stunt Race FX, and certainly not as good, but I did have a good time with it back then. The only reason I rented it was because I thought it was some sort of sequel to Stunt Race FX, which of course is not the case (see Acclaim logo). There was a theme for each driver that would play while racing but funnily enough, most of them didn't really fit a racing game. It's the case with Spike's mellow theme, but it was always my favorite because of that.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "12", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
