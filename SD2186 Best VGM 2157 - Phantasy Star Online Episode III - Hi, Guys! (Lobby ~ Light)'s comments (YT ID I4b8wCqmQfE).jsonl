I remember being quite bummed by the card/grid battle system Sega introduced, but I haven't played enough of it back then to truly have an opinion on the game. I can at least say the soundtrack is very solid, just like its prequels.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "13", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

Its a shame i love a lot about the game but the fact that you made a character you couldnt use and the card based battle system was odd, however the story and world building was really interesting, it was just kinda messy to figure out from what i remember.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "EXEGUNSO", "channel": "UCpVGSPvqQ8P2-84EQtMnuVQ", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwajQAxEZL5rqbAQkJHTeUPU2ovW2g2NKtqnJJ3tQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

I do admit that I didn't like how it wasn't the traditional genre PSO became known for, but the depth and beauty of the game was still there. I spent countless hundred hours playing between the Heros and the Arks storyline. Trying to get rare cards and how often I could get the true ending.\n\nI REALLY wish Sega would release an HD port of all 3 episodes for the Switch with online capabilities. I cannot fathom how often I'd glady play those games over anything I own on current gen consoles.
