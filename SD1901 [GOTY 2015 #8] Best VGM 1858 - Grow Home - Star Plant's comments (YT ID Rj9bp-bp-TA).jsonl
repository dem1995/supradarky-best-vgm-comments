{"cid": "Ugjp5XEyl2W3_HgCoAEC", "text": "You play as a small robot named Bud and you grow giant plants to reach your spaceship in the sky, what's not to like? Great presentation, a nice little open world to play around with and after a few hours, you're done. The short length can be viewed as a negative, but I feel like this lets the game never overstay its welcome, leaving it on a high note. At first, controlling Bud feels awkward and clumsy, but I quickly got used to it and it's part of the challenge, making it a great \"rock climbing\" game. There's some nice progression as well as you collect the crystals. For the price, I just can't recommend it enough if you have a few hours to spend! Fun fact: it was first made internally by a couple of people at Ubisoft as a small experiment, but they had so much fun with it that they decided to release it as a full game.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "30", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
