{"cid": "UgwuIhVWLLxuoFNISZ14AaABAg", "text": "Somehow both Esthar in FF8 and Solaris in Xenogears have this specific musical aura. Perhaps this one is a bit too quirky, well Esthar theme of Silence and Motion is also pretty awkward. But both of these tunes are something you don't get as an aesthetic association in many games. Only Squaresoft- categorically won't call them SQ-E. Only they can manage to make games that have dreamy places like the Gold Saucer, Esthar and the Nautilus in FF13. I didn't get that vibe in FF15. Not my favorite game in terms of tone.  But yeah, these modern cities all get quirky music.
