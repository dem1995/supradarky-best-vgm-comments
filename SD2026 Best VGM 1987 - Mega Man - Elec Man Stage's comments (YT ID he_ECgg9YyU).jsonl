{"cid": "Ugilqvs5LfXFdXgCoAEC", "text": "If there's one thing to remember 1987 for in terms of video games, it's not the quality of any of the games that were released, but how Mega Man graced us with this box art. Nothing else matters in comparison. Seriously though, Inafune actually attributed this game's bad sales in North America to this box art, not only because the art is ugly, but because it absolutely doesn't represent what's in the game. Mega Man 2 really is what propulsed the series financially. Still, Mega Man was a quality game and Capcom's first real foray into the console market as all of their previous releases were Arcade ports. The game's cartoony graphics with its big sprites were super refreshing back then and the gameplay was top notch, so much so that Capcom stuck with it for all its 8-bit sequels (MM9 and 10 included). I believe this was also the first game to feature stages that you could select and play in any order you want.
