Sadly, XC2 turned out to be more or less a retelling from XC, but with squeaky anime girls everywhere, and a lot of them. Also it comes with an extremely generic main character (Rex look almost identical to the Sword Art Online or Attack on Titan guy, but with very ugly pants). I don't think I ever had such a bad aftertaste after a game. It's not necessarily a bad game (it's probably still good), but it tries way too hard to mimic XC, and the amount of fan service was way too much for me.\n\nAll I wanna say is, just because you like XC doesn't mean you'll like XC2. In order to appreciate a playthrough of XC2 you more or less need to be a hardcore anime fan who doesn't dislike fan service everywhere.
