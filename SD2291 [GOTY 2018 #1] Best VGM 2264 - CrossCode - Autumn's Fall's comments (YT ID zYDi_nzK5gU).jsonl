{"cid": "Ugw87FDYWq8mhsdGGT54AaABAg", "text": "Not only is CrossCode my favorite game of 2018, but it's not even close. I still remember last year with Hollow Knight being my favorite game of 2017, I was perplexed to see it fly under so many radars. The Switch release changed everything and with CrossCode set to release on Nintendo's console as well, I hope it gets the same huge boost of attention it deserves. CrossCode takes the best parts of Secret of Mana, Zelda, Lufia II and Wild Arms dungeons, then mixes that with awesome fast paced combat inside a MMORPG setting. The result is nothing short of incredible. Even outside traversal is filled with parkour puzzles to reach the various chests and it's so much fun that I wanted to get all of them (made pleasant by a chests counter in each area). The soundtrack and the pixel graphics feel simply perfect. Even the story is intriguing and full of likable characters, including great humor. Really, I have a hard time finding negatives for this one and I still think about the game which I will surely return to as they release more quests and expansions (just like a MMORPG). I don't say this easily, but to me CrossCode is nothing short of a masterpiece and just like with Hollow Knight before it, my favorite game of the year is now one of my favorites of all time.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "69", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

And beside that : a bestiary of 20 differents monsters throught the game, a plot which is ... well, decent at best, the level design has problems i cant' explain well as a non-native english speaker (it's frequently difficult to see on which height you can or will land when jumping, and it's REALLY annoying a lots of time during the game)... In fact, the problem with crosscode is that it has a lot of very good idea, and a lot of really annoying ones. GOTY 2018 ? certainly not. it's at least way too long for it's own good, for what it has to offer.

{"cid": "UgyFaL1GGugmbok9Ogd4AaABAg", "text": "The fact that no one is talking about this game even after it's been out for like almost a year is just perplexing. This was an easy goty for me last year and it was just sad that nobody has even heard of it. No big or small youtubers made any videos on it and in general it lacked the attention it deserved.\n\nThe ONLY negative part I can think of about this game is that it's almost a bit too perfect -- there aren't much things left to talk about after you finish the game because everything is wrapped up so nice n' tight. And that's hardly a negative point.\n\nHopefully the Switch port will set this right and the folks at RadicalFishGames will get the money and fame they need to get their next, undoubtedly great project started with a bang!", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "NaCl", "channel": "UCEIzSa0ze_KWENAfl_PdT_Q", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyhCNp3yzAkR7vA_qxnofagNdVvagdQrOS3m1lp=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

Not often, but once in a while.
