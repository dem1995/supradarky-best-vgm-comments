{"cid": "Ugz8begu7XCAn4blNtd4AaABAg", "text": "This pet-sized Metroid-like can be finished in one sitting (my Steam shows 3 hours), and sometimes that's exactly what I need as a bridge between two big games. It has some surprisingly innovative gameplay moments thanks to the mechanic where you can switch between being a fast kitty or a powerful cat in a mech suit (doesn't that sound awesome?). The music and graphics are directly inspired by Metroid. For under 10$, this is a recommended breath of fresh air.", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "34", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
