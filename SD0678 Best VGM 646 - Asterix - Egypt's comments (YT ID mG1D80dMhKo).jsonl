{"cid": "UgwerpTfUvG9q0IgkHJ4AaABAg", "text": "Damn. Alberto's tracks always had some deep bass and heavy beats. At a sound design level, he managed tri percussion in an unbeatable way, and made the great choice of keeping the triangle high enough like to be hearable, but also low enough like to actually sound bassy; but also he composed the beats and the bass to be driving, and in cases like this, funky as hell.\n And let's not forget that each one of his tracks had strong, catchy melodies. His music was actually the most melodious of all of the european composers.\n Surprisingly enough, he never had any considerable knowledge of music theory. He said he just followed his instinct when composing. And what an instinct, I must admit. I wish I could compose as many well-crafted, memorable tracks as him.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Retro CreaTbJ", "channel": "UCZX-E2oTTtl40mdsq1_y2Pg", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyUeOFho7Vm413aK6zX9oSyBU_JYRAoacVI368R=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
