{"cid": "Ugz03iDqNt7tTw1O9lR4AaABAg", "text": "Shin'en continue being gaming wizards with this beautiful game using only 231 MB of storage and almost non-existant loading times. It took me about 5 hours to complete everything (except for the arcade games) and it was a complete pleasure. You're a tourist who visits various small islands inspired by real locales and end up discovering mysteries surrounding them. Exploring and solving puzzles is a joy thanks to the setting, and it even has a few mini-dungeons. The voxel graphics are stunning and the music has some highlights like this one when you dive underwater (DKC vibes!). I can only hope Shin'en made this game as a prologue and will fully build on it.", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "31", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
