{"cid": "UgzHhgBXKtWlkuZppMV4AaABAg", "text": "This game was made by the creators of the Descent series and the original composers are on board as well, so if you were fan of that series (or Forsaken), you will feel right at home with Overload. It can get tricky to traverse the various mazes when you're not used to the full six degrees of no-gravity freedom, so it only highlights the game's good level design that I rarely felt lost. The pure shooting and dodging gameplay is as fun as ever, but I did find myself skipping over the surrounding story after a while. The variety of the levels is also quite lacking, mostly switching between metal corridors and caves which means it's very hard to think about a specific, memorable stage. Still, this kind of gameplay is so rare that it was a nice breath of fresh air. It took me about 7 hours to finish which felt like the perfect length.
