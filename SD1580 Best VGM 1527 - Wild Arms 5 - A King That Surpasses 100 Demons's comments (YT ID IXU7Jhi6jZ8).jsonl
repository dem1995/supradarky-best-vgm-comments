{"cid": "UgissawAXjumEXgCoAEC", "text": "Wild Arms 5's soundtrack is awesomely varied thanks to a list of great composers who each have their own style. This track by Kouda in particular is completely different from anything else in the game. I wasn't fan of it at first, but this chaotic/powerful boss theme quickly grew on me. Kouda composed the music for the Devil May Cry games and you can hear some similarities, probably on purpose since this is the theme for the hardest boss in the game (by far), Ragu o Ragula, the recurring secret boss of the Wild Arms series. I wasn't even close to beating it in WA5, his signature attack \"One Trillion Degrees\" basically wiped me out instantly. Very fitting theme.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "19", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
