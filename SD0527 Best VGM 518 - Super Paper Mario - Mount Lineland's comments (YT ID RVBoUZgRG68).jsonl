The plot is amazing, intriguing and different to other mario games.not to mention, the graphics are stunning.having to let you go 2d AND 3d doesn't really takeaway from the real paper mario field.but then it also stays 2d so most hardcore mario fans can enjoy this masterpiece bit by bit.Also, you can play as the 4 main mario characters, each with something that makes it unique.each world is also no where near cliche.the music is quite possibly the best in any mario game, (just barely beating mario and luigi dream team) if not any game ever! And even then there's so much else to do! The villains are a lot better than any other mario game to date.each has there own personality. Mimi is a creepy but pretty defensless villain which can pack a serious punch of pain to the opponent, count bleck is a miserable villain who seeks to create new worlds, but instead tries to end life for good. Chuck ( I think his name is) is a powerful defensive beast of a villain which always tries to get in your way.and, my favourite video character of all time, Dimentio.This guy is fun, energetic, yet his amazing comeback to count bleck has never ceased to amaze me.he has always left you wandering, why is he there?he doesn't really do ANYTHING until the end, which gives him an AMAZING build up of a final battle.And a secret side kind of plot which could make the greatest gamer cry, this is easily my favourite Videogame of all time.and +, CHUCK FOR SMASH BROTHERS THO?", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "1234567890", "channel": "UCNUUdzO7ux1QUicfXODb_Pw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwfB_G8Bi2Giv5f0l-etAsqMhJkemGNWoUVfeGMjQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
