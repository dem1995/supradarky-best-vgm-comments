It was made as a homage to Chrono Trigger (SD's most favourite game of all time), and was ruined with (from what I read off a few reviews) an annoying encounter rate, poor story, a flawed battle system, and some obvious bugs, including game-crashing ones. If you like Chrono Trigger's feel, it might give you some fun, but... Just be warned, you're going to be playing the game for the battle interface. Which you'll have, like, 95% of the time. ", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Jirt", "channel": "UCE-dsUNjcD8hQyiyxfvu2mg", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJylkHX8alswF9JDpe2_b5XHqDtkCupgpiqB3wI7=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
