The whole soundtrack is made up of completely ambient themes, very scary ones. They help make this game and its different ghost encounters extremely unsettling. Until I played this in 2002, I hadn't been this scared playing a video game. I guess I find creepy ghosts that can go through walls and floors much more efficient in the horror department (or japanese horror in general). It doesn't help that you control a helpless character only equipped with a first person camera. The \"battle\" mechanic is actually very fun and part of why I find this series stands out from the rest.
