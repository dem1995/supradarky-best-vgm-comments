{"cid": "UgzNbUCrUQdbGQecPX54AaABAg.8jcbA8nPmvE8jck0MoR4hj", "text": "@SupraDarky Man this game let me down ultra mega hard. So here is this series with amazing games that comes back after several years with a new game. I was so hyped, and even though they did a terrible job porting the game over with subtitle mistakes and shitty performance out the box, I had a great time playing it. This was the first time I would get to play a Ys game close to its release, as I found this series a year or two ago, long after the other games came out.\n\nThe music is great, the gameplay is great, the characters are decent, with only a few problems. It rly annoyed me just how low the nun lady tore her dress, that's just completely unrealistic. and it also annoyed me just how much the devs wanted to make whats-her-face the main love interest, especially with that cliche nude bathing scene at the start. I personally thought that the smith was best girl, and was annoyed how little romantic choices there were for me to make (at all, even with whats-her-face).\n\nThe environments were awesome to run around in, and when you finally explored all of the island, there was a lot to look back at. I would recommend buying this game just to see the island, as they put a lot of detail into it. But alas, there is a problem: the story. The story is great until you get to the end, although the tiff with nameless was a bit stupid. Really unrealistic, nobody could be that demented and appear so normal, but whatever. And talk about a needless character death.\n\nWhen you start out, there are so many unknowns that I can't even begin to name them all, and over the course of the game, they get revealed to you in a fairly suspenseful manner. Some things you see from a mile away, but most you don't have a clue about. I can't really get into it without major spoilers, but basically, the story is fine until the end. Things get funky, and the true ending is complete bullshit. A completely random deity shows up and does something to one of the main characters that pisses me off to no end. The god is all \"Hey, I know everybody you know and love is dead because of this thing, but let me make you an integral part of it. Now you get to stay alive forever and are responsible for using it wisely.\" And the main char says \"That sounds like a great idea, I bet we can use this thing that murders everyone to benefit people!\" (Also, how the heck doesn't this character have an existential crisis? They survived all that time after such a terrible fate and finally got justice for their civilization, and have no mental breakdown?)\n\nLike what the fuck! Am I the only one wondering where the winged demigod things went? Where the fuck did this outrageously busty deity come from!??! And she takes credit for the tree?? The fuck, that tree comes from the Origins game, and it had no freaky alien inside of it!", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "David Pontius", "channel": "UCbkUm_ZTToFxNW9nTTimKQA", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxbfYJHdqHOpiZwTOz562wvRP-Hi56y3R-HqQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

It killed her people and she committed suicide (or the closest thing) to not join the other guardians. Then she meets Adol, gets new friends, finishes what she set out to do long ago in the blizzard (try and get help from outside the kingdom) and sacrifices herself to stop the Lacrimosa for good. She should either have not been resurrected and finally known some peace, or not have died and just try to move on with life. Maybe travel and find a new purpose, as she got justice for her people and has no more ties to the island.\n\nAlso, where in the actual fuck did Gaia come from??? The Menoa trees are from the Origins game and have a conscious of their own (we see that in the other games as well). Where the heck did that weird alien thing come from???
