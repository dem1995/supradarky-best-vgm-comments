{"cid": "UggxM49Quc8UL3gCoAEC", "text": "I don't know a lot of major releases that got such a late release during the year. Shenmue came out in Japan on December 29th 1999. I don't think I need to repeat myself on how great I think this series is, but when just listening to this ambient walking theme takes me all the way back and rushes me with nostalgia, you know it was something special. Still to this day, I don't think a video game immersed me as much as this series. The Dreamcast may have not lived long, but its library of quality games was enough for me to never regret buying one.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "43", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

I've decided for a quite a while now which theme I would pick for #2000 and I can confirm that it won't follow the current trend of the game being released on the same year as the number in the list.
