This allowed for more creativity to be given to the game in other areas such as plot and  musical score. The devs could insert more of what they envision the game to be, instead of what their company envisions it to be. Their company is, of course, most concerned with making the most amount of money off their game, and adjusts the \"formula\" as necessary to do so. In today's market and formula, the devs spend most of their time on graphics, animation and the action within the game. Ive seen many old games, with horrible graphics and animations (even for the year it was created), but incredible plots, and music that matches the emotion of the plot or scene. You don't see this in today's archetype. Today you mostly see incredible graphics and animations, but cheesy, rehashed plot and composition. That not only applies to RPG's but virtually every game genre. \n\n~~Thats why a lot of these old VGMs like this are precious and revisited long after one stops playing its game, even in the PS2/Xbox era. The track itself actually meant something; had its own feel within the scene or area that it plays in. A feel that one can only understand by being there and experiencing it. \n\nThis also holds true for those same JRPGS. Final Fantasies, as an example: Compare FF4-9 to FF13 and 14, and the shift in the archetype becomes apparent.; not that 13 and 14 aren't good games with their own positive qualities. MMO's are another example: Compare pretty much any MMO 10-12 years ago, to what it is today. \n\nIts simply the shift in generations, and the advancements in technology that created that shift. The majority of the new generation of gamers WANT those perfect graphics and combat, over story and music; that's what they grew up playing. Thus as a business, game companies have to change their formulas and adapt to this in order to compete, or die off. \n\nAn example of this is Konami. A lot of geniuses from the 90s era, such as the creator of Castlevania, the creator of Megaman, the creator of Metal Gear Solid. All of them have left Konami to develop games on their own...because Konami doesn't want to publish that old archetype anymore.
