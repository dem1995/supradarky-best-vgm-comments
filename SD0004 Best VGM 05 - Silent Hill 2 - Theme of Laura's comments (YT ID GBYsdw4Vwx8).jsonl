{"cid": "Ugg76pU8EmoqA3gCoAEC.8GfZl1cEVKn8NZs0PZuH6L", "text": "@KTBMedia\nIt's an interesting question, for many the answer will simply be this game, Silent Hill 2. It doesn't rely on cheap spooks (although there are one or two in there, of course), instead it focuses on creating a bleak setting and examining the character's psyche, on a much deeper level than may be apparent initially. 3 also achieves a similar effect with a story coming from a very, very different angle to that of James', but playing the first game (which, again, comes from a very different tone to 2) is essential before playing 3 as it is a direct continuation, where 2 can stand perfectly on it's own.\n\nIf you thik you'd enjoy old school point and click games, I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream is a very psychological experience. The \"gameplay\" is pretty much what you'd expect from such a game, but the story and exploration of it's characters stand out way beyond a regular old game of it's style. I don't find it grabs me in a normal \"horror\" way, but it definately sticks with you.\n\nThere are other great horror games that don't rely on psychological horror to achieve their spooks. For something more on atmosphere and the thrill of survival, the game that does that best for me is the remake of Resident Evil. Put it on a more challenging difficulty and it's a very tense experience. Plus it has a pretty interesting story if you pay attention all the information available to you.\n\nAnd hey, if you still want to play something hide and seek style (kinda like these modern jump scare only games, only better) take a look at Siren + Blood Curse which nail the atmosphere.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "IHeart16Bit", "channel": "UCo4yOwk2LAh_9LrM9PCRgNQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyo0ZZEMSQbkWfhJlqKve84cPRaf_SPe_G4dXdM=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
