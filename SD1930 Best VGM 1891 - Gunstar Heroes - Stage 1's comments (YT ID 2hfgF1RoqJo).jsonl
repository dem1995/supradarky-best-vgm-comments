You SERIOUSLY need some more Genesis tracks on your channel. People bash it for having \"poor quality\" and \"terrible instrumentation\" but just trust me when I say that there are some things that only the Genesis could pull off, namely techno, like the Streets of Rage series, and more gritty, hardcore metal tracks like Thunder Force IV. And speaking of Thunder Force, by far some of the best music soundtracks on the system. Thunder Force III and IV kick some serious 16-bit tail. If you haven't heard either of those soundtracks DO SO RIGHT NOW!!
