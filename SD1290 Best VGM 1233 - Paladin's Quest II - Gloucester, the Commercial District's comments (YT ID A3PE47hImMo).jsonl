Only downside of the game came from the numerous battles that played out too long.

I think PQ1 is a good unique game, but this might be one of my favorite snes RPGs. It took me a﻿ couple hours to get into the battle mechanics and I did use the emulator's fast forward a lot during battles, but it just clicked with me. Nigel with all its districts was especially memorable. Great OST too, though the battle themes are weaker than its prequel's.", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
