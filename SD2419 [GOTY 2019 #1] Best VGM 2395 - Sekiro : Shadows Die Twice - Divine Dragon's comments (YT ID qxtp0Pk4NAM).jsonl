{"cid": "UgwMlvbWzebZXkL-3at4AaABAg", "text": "Incredibly enough, this is the first time a non-indie game is my GOTY since Zelda ALBW in 2013. Not having played the previous From Software games during their year of release might have something to do with it since they make some of my favorite games of all time. 2019 was the year of From Software for me because I somehow played through Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne and Sekiro without going crazy. Three amazing games for different reasons. It didn't start well with Sekiro however because I almost gave up after the first few hours, it was simply too difficult and I didn't feel like the combat was clicking. I persevered and took the best decision, which was to keep the optional Hirata Estate zone for later and stop the road block I hit with Lady Butterfly. I played through the main zones instead and something magical happened: the fight with Genichiro. This is when it all clicked after first thinking it was impossible, the fight taught me how to play the game and how I needed to forget about my Dark Souls/Bloodborne playstyle. Sekiro is a rhythm action game, you must dance with your opponent by constantly switching between being the aggressor until you are parried, then defend until you parry yourself and go back to attacking. Everything made sense afterwards and my powerless frustration was replaced by analyzing each of my opponents' movements like a chess match. In Sekiro, there is no way to just level up and overpower a boss, you have to learn the fight. I could have failed 100 times against a boss, but after the first time I beat it I always felt like I could beat it another 10 times in a row because I mastered it. As much as I love the Soulsborne games, I often find myself beating a boss and just never wanting to fight it again, wondering how I did it and if luck was involved. Sekiro made me a better gamer and if I can do it, you can too.", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "50", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

{"cid": "Ugx55ZI_T-iXlt-w6XB4AaABAg", "text": "Honestly while I liked Sekiro a lot, it just didn't hit the highest notes of any of the other FromSoft games for me. The music is probably the biggest reason for that, as usually the highlights of these games are the boss fights and the most memorable ones have amazing music that enhances them immensely. The soundtrack in Sekiro is good when it comes to enhancing the atmosphere, but it doesn't really add intensity or emotion to any moment IMO. Even Dark Souls II does a better job.\n\nAlso I guess the lack of DLC really hurts. DS2 would have absolutely nothing on Sekiro without Eleum Loyce or Brume Tower.
