How do you feel about this? While I'd prefer another game like TTYD, I think this is a good step in the right direction... unless the paper mario in the game is entriely his Sticker Star representation.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "sety holsety", "channel": "UCFkH2zWfGhedh_XasIaY5aw", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyhMdTLg3eRKaaAU5qrcxOL2dX8791N9nHXQVfYDg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

It's about Mario&Luigi-like controls and being a Mario RPG game with partners.\n\nInteresting...

No leveling, no partners, no badges. Who in their right mind makes a Paper Mario game without experience points, partners or badges? Even the plot was minimal... To this day I can't wrap my head around it at all, Intelligent Systems is usually so damn competent.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "sety holsety", "channel": "UCFkH2zWfGhedh_XasIaY5aw", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyhMdTLg3eRKaaAU5qrcxOL2dX8791N9nHXQVfYDg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
