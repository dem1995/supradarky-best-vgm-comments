SH1 while not that emotional in comparison to 2. It has IMO the best cast of characters in the series, full of colors and great lines.

The storyline rewards you by the end, but for experiencing through that you need to fight your way with the godawful controls.\n\nAs for the rest, I don't have a good opinion on them.
