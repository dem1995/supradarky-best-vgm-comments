This song scared the shit out of me when I was young, to be honest. Talking to everyone, seeing them scared about the apocalypse that was unavoidably coming...really brought you into the world and the despair that was felt by everyone. Unlike most people, THIS is my favorite zelda game- it had the best characters and atmosphere to me, and it was so very dark!", "time": "9 years ago", "author": "Akerfeldtfan", "channel": "UCA94C7Pkxab4JsElehHU68w", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJy617Jvxo14SWJXnjYPq5_hV2Ij81dAz2FYHiH-=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

This song, Oath to Order, Song of Healing, as well as the song that plays in the beginning in the woods when Link is on Epona mean so much to me in terms of video game music and sentimental value. One of the reasons I listen to black metal is because it allows me to evoke my deepest emotions when I need to the most, and to me this is almost the video game music equivalent to black metal.
