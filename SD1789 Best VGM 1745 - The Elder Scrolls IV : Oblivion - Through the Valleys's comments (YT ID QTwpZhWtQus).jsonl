In Oblivion you had amazing Dark Brotherhood quests filled with intrigue, mystery, nastiness and creepiness. In Skyrim... not as much. Skyrim's quests don't seem as well written or engrossing as Oblivion's, and like I said, not as deep. Skyrim also mainly has a lot of quests -- quantity over quality. Most of those quests are just 'kill bandit/dragon x in location y'. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Skyrim's quests sucked, but there's a good case to be made for them being worse than Oblivion's, and some are downright boring and easy. I honestly hardly even remember Skyrim's quests, which is weird since I played Skyrim for a while. Oblivion's quests, though... all the Dark Brotherhood quests, the Shivering Isles quests, the Fighter's Guild and Blackwood Company, the Mythic Dawn, the Mages' Guild, Canvas the Castle, the arena... more memorable than Skyrim, more fun.\n\nI also found Skyrim to be depressing when it comes to the graphics. I mean, I get that the province is supposed to be bleak, cold, and often barren, but sometimes it felt like it could've used more color. Maybe more interesting sky effects, more varied buildings and building interiors, etc etc. Even the inns in this game (which are supposed to look warm and inviting) just looked kind of bland and cold to me. Fire usually seems pale yellow in Skyrim, and everything is just so serious and bleak that it gets annoying after a while.\n\nThese reviews explain it pretty well:\nhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/615805-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/reviews/review-150200\n\nhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/615805-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/reviews/review-149090", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Enigma", "channel": "UCCDHyEhYp3O8_c23H0sZkog", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyI7R-qsl8bpciN_79zldFIoPUxZjoV8JsXD4xC=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
