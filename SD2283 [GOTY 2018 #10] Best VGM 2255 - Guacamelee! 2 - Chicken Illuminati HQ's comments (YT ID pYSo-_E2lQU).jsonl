{"cid": "UgyLOZ0LQd_rgTQlRO54AaABAg", "text": "Did you like the first Guacamelee? You will love this sequel. You did not? You won't. The first game made my top 3 of the year and this game is probably better in every way, but I cannot deny that after 5 years I wanted a bit more than \"more of the same, but better\". The luchador setting is still fresh, but it doesn't feel unique anymore. The combat mechanics are still amazing and easily one of my favorites in the genre. I do feel like there is something I cannot explain about this series, which is how I completely get addicted to it and love it the whole way through, but then a couple months pass and I have hard time remembering most of its moments. One thing for sure, I do remember the Chicken Illuminati HQ. The chicken transformation and its mechanics were definitely a highlight of this sequel.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "25", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
