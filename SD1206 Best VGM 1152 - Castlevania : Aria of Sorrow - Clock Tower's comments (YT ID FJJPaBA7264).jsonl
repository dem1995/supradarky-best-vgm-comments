It's one of my favorite games in the series, and I love it. But it still confuses me a bit: I know that a lot of people praise it for being so fast paced. Well, I feel like it's a bit.........TOO fast paced. Bosses end too quickly, and they're usually pretty lame (except for Succubus, Galamoth, and Olrox). The game is just too easy, and the Inverted Castle?: SssssssssssssssTUPID. I'm sorry, but it just feels repetitive going through the same castle again. I know Portrait of Ruin (no clue why people hate that game so much) uses pallete swaps from previous areas, but the atmosphere and music feels completely different. BUTT: I'm not saying Symphony of the Night is bad. It's awesome. Go watch SomecallmeJohnnie's review and you'll see why. I just think that when it comes to the Metroidvania games, Dawn of Sorrow, Aria of Sorrow, and especially Portrait of Ruin are better.\n\nSO.......what did we learn from this short rant/mini-review?\n\nA.
