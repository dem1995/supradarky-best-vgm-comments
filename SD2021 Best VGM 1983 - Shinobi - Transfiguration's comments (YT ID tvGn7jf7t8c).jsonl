{"cid": "UggQHkiPhixMpngCoAEC", "text": "This game was awesome, but had some really tough spots. There is one level that basically has no ground, and you can only wall run for so long without attacking an enemy, so it has lots of enemies placed strategically around to make it through. There were some tough deaths in that one. Your sword would also constantly drain your life so it encouraged you to run through the levels. The way to really beat bosses was to kill enemies in quick succession, and then hit them last. Lots of interesting mechanics at play, that made it a challenge. Still a fantastic game, and I do remember liking the music.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Postmita", "channel": "UCap1O3C5ZRpTcP0Gw9NUCWA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzeXz7kBbnYLH9TEnQbsMv7XeALuLkN7vCnskSa=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
