I like almost everything about it, except where I'm at in the game, it seems the fetch stuff quests far outweigh the kill stuff quests. Or at least offer more experience. Does this change after a while? I'm way under leveled, and just stopped. I re visit it every once in a while and go back to old towns, enjoy the music and finish new quests that pop up.
