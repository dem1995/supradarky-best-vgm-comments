{"cid": "UgxrZnqItLEub_MCxxR4AaABAg", "text": "I see a good looking Metroidvania, I buy. Think of a mix between a Metroidvania and Dark Souls with Spanish vibes... and then apply a coat of Catholic paintings mixed with horror. The dark and disturbing atmosphere is enough for it to be a game I won't forget. The combat system is satisfying, though the barebones skill tree felt like a missed opportunity. I thought the difficulty was great and while I heard it's too hard for some, I thought it was much easier than any Souls game. By far the most negative aspect was the map traversal because of the horrible lack of teleportation points, I really don't understand what they were thinking by adding so few of them. Oh and if you discover an item you cannot reach yet or a merchant, good luck trying to remember where they were because of the map not marking anything. It's too bad really, because apart from that I can hardly find any big faults. It's a great game.", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "43", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

Happy to say it is a pretty well fleshed out Metroidvania with a huge map, constantly intriguing atmosphere/story,  tons of hidden items/upgrades/relics/\"powers\" etc, quest lines. \nAside from the obvious map and teleport problems you mentioned.  One thing I found a bit annoying was having many required \"traversal\" items (trying to avoid spoilers) hinge on a limited relic equip system...I really don't see the advantage from not having most of them \"always on\".", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "xSayPleasex", "channel": "UCtU-V-Sncad2nwEwxs51uuQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxmGOfkaE1c4j-qaIXAz-EsQYvMhI2P1q5DBDb_=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
