I can't decide there are so many able contenders. There's the 4x games of the 90s like Master of Orion 2 and Master of Magic or the first X-Com. Nintendo Classics of the 80s and 90s. Warcraft III? Hard to decide. \n\nFavorite RPG Series... Chrono Trigger wasn't exactly a series so I'll say Dragon Quest because even though I've only played or am playing I-V it's more consistent than Final Fantasy. I mean I would never play Dragon Warrior on the NES again or recommend to anyone that they do but they 'fixed' it in later editions vs Final Fantasy which has its amazing hits but its underwhelming misses. Same with other leading contender, Fallout. Fallout and Fallout NV are phenomenal but the others just aren't as good. \n\nThere's aspects from each (JRPG/WRPG) that I enjoy it really depends on how well a particular title is executed. In the SNES era, JRPGs ruled to the point where I'm hard pressed to come up with a WRPG for the SNES besides shitty ports like Eye of the Beholder. Final Fantasy IV (II) FF VI (III) Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana (action RPG but w/e), Super Mario RPG... All amazeballs. On the PC there was Ultima Underworld the Stygian Abyss (Skyrim in a Volcano Dungeon). Baldur's Gate series and Mass Effect are also very well done. Fallout I, II & New Vegas are also worthy games (well maybe not so much Fallout II, it kinda sprawls and sprawls + they railroad you with character vs player knowledge vis a vis world map locations)", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "BTG514", "channel": "UCjjlqJQqA81ZjyZXJGj28KQ", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzIXTchf0B2BJ0Jre1yswl5e-t7QPrqVrSvkg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

{"cid": "UgxK7MSkJyroMI5lDGZ4AaABAg", "text": "1. Never played one, but I'm planning on getting my hands on XI in September\n\n2. While the recent expansions have put me off World of Warcraft, once Classic is out I think it'll fill this spot. It's the perfect blend, where I know it well enough to not worry about learning mechanics, while also always providing new challenges and adventures. Only problem is that it requires a subscription. Otherwise my comfort games tend to change. Right now I'm engrossed in Persona 4 - while I've never played it before I watched a Let's Play way back, so in a way it's nostalgic, like going over to an old friend's house. \n\n3. Right now, probably Persona. It's the perfect blend between visual novel and RPG elements, and I adore how status effects are not only useful, but necessary. It's a trait I've sorely missed from a lot of games. I wonder if it holds true for Dragon Quest?\n\n4. I don't know if I've played enough RPGs to answer this question, especially when it comes to western ones, but for now I'll say Japanese. Thanks to Pokémon turn based combat has never bothered me, and overall I prefer their stories, settings and visuals. Japanese media tends to make stories that are energetic and happy, while also not being afraid to throw punches and throw in some genuine philosophical questions. It's a blend I enjoy, and one that's sorely missing from the media in my own country. I guess you can say i find a lot of western games to be too pessimistic. \n\nAlthough I do miss some of the freedom often present in western RPGs, and they can be fantastic at building a world. I've only done a brief visit to Morrowind, but my short experience there, along with visits to WoW and Everquest helps build a world that isn't always present in Japanese RPGs. Where you're just a nobody in a vast unexplored universe. It'd be interesting to see an eastern company try their hands on making a western-style RPG, and vice versa\n\n\n5.

I played Dragon Warrior 1 on the NES and Dragon Warrior VII on the PS1 back in the day, and I couldn't get into either of them... however, after playing Dragon Quest XI for the better part of 3 months, and finally beating it, I am going to go back and revisit what this series has to offer. I was blown away by how great Dragon Quest XI was...so that has to be my answer here.\n2. Hmm this is a tough question...it used to be the Madden and NBA 2K series years ago when they actually tried and made good advancements every year. But that was easily over a decade ago. Now? I'd probably say the Persona series. At least from 3 on up, they follow a similar flow, and you know what you are going to get with them.\n3. Has to be Final Fantasy for me. Even considering the last 18 years or so, the one thing you can't ever say is that they don't try new things. Plus, FFVII is my favorite game ever...which is shortly followed by FF Tactics and FFIX.\n4. JRPGs, but I still enjoy playing both. There are amazing games in both genres.\n5. Slime... moogles annoy me, and I don't like the looks of that rabite.

From what I can tell, the main difference is that the typical JRPG (such as Final Fantasy) focuses on teamwork; experiencing a story about/around a party of people, each with their strengths and weaknesses that complement and cover each other to make the party bigger than the sum of its parts. The classic western RPG (like Fallout 1&2) focuses much more on the singular hero, defying the world all on his own, overcoming challenges through his own wit and might.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Beremor", "channel": "UCTSFpOiTqvDvFv0EJan539w", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJylCbsLgP5gS31EBuJa4dECAB57SX-W9kwdOyGw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
