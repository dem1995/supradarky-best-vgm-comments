It's tough to do it that way, but ya just gotta say \"alright, the game's not goin' anywhere, it'll be there when I come back.\" and do what ya need to do. MMOs have really been able to captivate me though, at least in the mind. Anyways, here's my list.\n1: I've played a number of MMOs before, such as Black Desert Online, Runescape, and Elder Scrolls Online, but my favorite one has to be Final Fantasy XIV. The world, music, everything about it is really phenomenal.\n2: My favorite kind of character to play on FFXIV is a Hyur (human) Warrior, which is a tank class. It's really the only class I know how to play effectively, and honestly, good tanks are few and far between.\n3: It's tough to choose a fondest memory, but for me, I still feel warm thinking about my first few days playing the game, starting in the city of Limsa Lominsa, doing my first few quests, and meeting someone who would eventually show me the ropes and teach me to be an effective tank.\n4: Just one franchise is another tough decision. I think the Metroid series would have a really interesting MMO, if it would ever get one. Imagine taking your pick of, say, bounty hunter, Galactic Federation, space pirate, or maybe even Chozo, having your own ship, going to different planets and space stations, that kind of stuff. One reason I choose this is because I feel there's not enough MMOs to primarily feature ranged weapons (such as guns) as forms of combat, but that might just be my inner gun nut talking.\n5: I can't really answer this one because I haven't played either, sorry!", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "キーラン", "channel": "UC--LSubxdAEDuudX6hgT7CQ", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzX_Ot9KSNp74MXLUsk2qNOWO9n8EaZlA1p6rHuCQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

The base game was good but it was so long and gettign to the points where the story really picked up and the gameplay got better was fricking amazing.\n4: I feel like its hard to choose a franchise that could make an awesome MMO but my first thoughts were Castlevania, Fire Emblem or maybe Persona?

I've been playing since 2005 and I've met so many great people.\n4) Really, I'm pretty happy with Warcraft, though if I could choose, I'd like a reboot after Wrath of the Lich King or even Warcraft 3. I've been kind of disappointed by the story as of late. To be fair, though, I think MMORPGs (and RPGs in general, but from what I hear there's progress on that front) are long overdue for a renaissance, so by definition it's hard to say what kind of franchise would be suitable for the genre.\n5) World of Starcraft, definitely.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Beremor", "channel": "UCTSFpOiTqvDvFv0EJan539w", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJylCbsLgP5gS31EBuJa4dECAB57SX-W9kwdOyGw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
