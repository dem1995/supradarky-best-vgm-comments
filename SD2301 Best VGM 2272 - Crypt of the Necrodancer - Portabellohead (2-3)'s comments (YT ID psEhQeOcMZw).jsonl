{"cid": "UgyJ8cQ_KYz5d9KsG814AaABAg", "text": "I loved today's indie showcase for the Switch. The biggest surprise was certainly the announcement of Cadence of Hyrule, which is basically Crypt of the Necrodancer x Zelda. We've already seen collabs like Hyrule Warriors, but the fact that this from an indie just shows how important and seriously Nintendo view them. Props! While the game itself will certainly be fun, I'm most excited for the soundtrack by Danny B. Just hearing the Tal Tal Heights remix in the trailer brought a big smile.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "74", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
