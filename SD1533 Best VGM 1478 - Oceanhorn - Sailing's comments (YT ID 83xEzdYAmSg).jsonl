I just hope some of my videos won't be plastered with the 30 seconds-type ads or have their audio removed, that'd be terrible. I give all my support to those truly affected by this, which is most of the YouTubers posting Let's Plays, doing game reviews, previews, blogs, etc. The past copyright system was completely flawed and Google responded with an overkill system that's even more flawed.
