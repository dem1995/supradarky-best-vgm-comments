There is a big overworld map, you travel throughout different areas, you solve puzzles, you find items which unlock different paths, you have one character who has no dialogue and doesn't level, there isn't much storyline and dialogue and it's mostly inconsequential, there are themed dungeons with a boss at the end of each. It felt very similar to me to playing a link to the past. Listen to the sound effect when you find a new sticker, to me it sounds derivative of the sound that plays when you find an item in a chest in zelda. The only thing that makes this game significantly different in gameplay to a top down zelda is the battle system. Put a crappy turn based battle system in and they would play almost identically.\n\nI'm not the only one who feels this way, not that that makes me right or anything:\n\n\"Sticker Star has just as much in common with Super Mario World and the original Legend of Zelda as it does the other Paper Mario titles...While the trappings here are definitely Mario, the feel is just as much classic Zelda as anything else.\"\n\n-Destructoid", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Brucie Kibbutz", "channel": "UC8mEnTtWuRMxwDkOpYThvHw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxpzX22XRifjuXdW1YIo0Dg3gPigvl44ugimA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
