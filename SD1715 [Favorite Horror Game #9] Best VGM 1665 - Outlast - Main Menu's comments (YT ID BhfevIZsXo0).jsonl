The whole nightvision camera mechanic was simply perfect, I knew I was in for some scary time when I first turned it on and saw how realistic it felt. There were moments where I'd arrive at a door to a pitch black room and I'd just stand there, convincing myself to step inside with only the disorienting camera guiding you, making it feel quite claustrophobic.
