Good times.\n\nMind you, I had my Dreamcast since 2011, found at Goodwill for $20 (or something like that, I honestly don't remember. lol), it was in a box, came with a controller, a Jump Pack, a video input cable, an AC adapter, a phone cable, and the console itself. Although it did not came with any games, I had to wait till the next day to go to the antic store, the first games I got for the console were Sonic Adventure and Sega GT. For 1998 (in Japan), Sonic Adventure was definitely ahead of its time.\nNowadays I have over 80 games for the Dreamcast, with the rarest game I purchased is Cannon Spike (Yes I have a copy of Cannon Spike. lol). I honestly consider the Dreamcast to be superior than the N64, PS1, PS2, Xbox, the Nintendo Gamecube.
