{"cid": "UgzLtL30z4gzb9zwwLl4AaABAg", "text": "I completed this game last month (took me 105 hours to max/do everything) and I loved it. I kept pushing the game away because it was intimidating to start playing such a notoriously huge RPG. It's now my third favorite in the series after 5 and 3. It's basically a series of substories and some of them were super well written and memorable, even emotional. Unfortunately, there's some padding that lengthens the game by about 20-30 hours since you basically have to revisit each town/dungeon twice.", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
