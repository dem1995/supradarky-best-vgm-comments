{"cid": "UgiedtinUiERKngCoAEC", "text": "This franchise had such a unique, dreamy feel to it. I can't complain at Monolithsoft's output with a 3rd Xenoblade game announced for this year, but I sure would like to play a 3rd Baten Kaitos game as well. I'm pretty sure that will never happen, but at least I know that I will enjoy their next game no matter what series it's from. They're easily one of my favorite developers with Xenosaga, BK and Xenoblade in their portfolio.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "26", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
