Nothing mind blowing, but great when you want that jRPG fix. Eternia, Symphonia and Vesperia are my 3 favorites so far, but I really want to give Berseria a shot. I think Tales of Legendia is the only game I actually didn't like at all. One thing's for sure... it's easy to get lost with all these titles.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "19", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
