{"cid": "Ugy1INXnkiJhgHgwnut4AaABAg", "text": "I captured this a couple minutes ago directly from my PS4 with the game in Theater mode. What is there to say about Tetris, really? One of the greatest games of all time, now with a fresh coat of paint. It's quite the experience for the mind to be zoning out to the visuals and music while stacking your tetrominos. For someone like me who probably put thousands of hours on various Tetris versions, it makes it even easier to zone out because I don't feel like I have to put much effort to complete the stages even on Hard. I actually bought a PSVR because of this game and while I did enjoy the game with it even more, I do have to say I was not THAT impressed by its implementation. I keep reading that it's a mindblowing experience but that simply wasn't the case for me, it was enjoyable but nothing crazy either. I even thought the graphics took a huge hit inside VR with everything looking very blurry, unlike other VR games I tried. I might be the weird one here. All in all, it will still be my go-to version of Tetris from now on.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "37", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
