This is THE video game theme and there's no need for words, really. As I said in the previous upload, I also feel like that #1000 video was special and I want to keep it that way. I do however want to use this Comments section to thank all of you for the continued support after all these years and give you each a digital thumbs up for helping me create and evolve such a nice VGM community, we did this together. To you who has been following me since the beginning, for a couple years or even just a couple days. It will soon be 10 years since I started this project, which is honestly mindblowing when you think how old we were then. I still remember how obscure the VGM scene was back then and how I thought nobody would really care about my videos, thinking I was one of those \"weird nerdy people who like music from video games\". I'm sure glad I was wrong and decided to upload that Wild Arms Town theme. I'm also very glad my lazy self decided to go with an unranked list because frankly, that's what kept me going for all these years: uploading whatever track I feel like, whenever I can, without any pressure, with an awesome community.", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "320", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
