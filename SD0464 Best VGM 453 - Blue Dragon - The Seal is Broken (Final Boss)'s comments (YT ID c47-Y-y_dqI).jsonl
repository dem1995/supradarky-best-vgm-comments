{"cid": "Ugh8GAtvHDwbcngCoAEC", "text": "Okay, after years of listening to this song, I have to get how much I love this song off of my chest.\n\nIt gives me freaking chills for how GORGEOUS it is. It knocks me off of my feet with the first freaking chord, and it just keeps building and building your anticipation. The vocals are so authoritative and powerful starting at :54; I cannot help but want to sing with them, and sing with FORCE, almost screaming, as if calling out to a vast army, stating that we will not fall; we will not stand down. The cadence of the syllables in this song just make my knees weak with sheer admiration and awe, and everything just EXPLODES at 3:12. The cadence of the lyrics....holy crap, I have never heard anything better. It holds that same authority, but amps it up to an 11, almost like that same army displaying their power through the complexity of their song. The words are said with such a staunch, almost immovable confidence, and the female vocals just emblazon that resolve, showing it for the power it truly has. FREAKING. LOVE IT. This is still a song that will bring tears to my eyes with how moved I am by it if I haven't listened to it in a good while. \n\nThank you so much SupraDarky for sharing this song - it truly is an amazing, amazing piece. <3", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Tricaudae Studio", "channel": "UCSCwNi05RLhWRBvOBFg4LEg", "votes": "39", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwaGyQc5IRZxg7pp87Zzx-7MRb90fZz_dLZS8mL=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
