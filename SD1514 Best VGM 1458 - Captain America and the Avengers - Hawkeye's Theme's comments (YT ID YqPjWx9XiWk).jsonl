He has twice given up being Captain America, becoming first the \"Nomad\" and again as \"the Captain\", because he could not answer blindly to the government. That was in the 70's-80's. He has his principles and morals that make him the heart of the Avengers like Superman of the JLA. A general once asked him about his loyalty.
