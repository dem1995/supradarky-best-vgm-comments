The story wasn't really done justice by the poor translation: it wasn't always clear what the plot points were as a result. Same was true of Illusion of Gaia as well: horrible translation really hurt what would've been a good story.\n\nI preferred Illusion of Gaia overall though. Terranigma was technically superior, with better graphics, sound quality, soundtrack, and (IMO) better gameplay mechanics, but Illusion of Gaia had one of the biggest emotional impacts on me of any game ever.
