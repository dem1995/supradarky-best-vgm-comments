Even if the gameplay shift in the middle of the game was spoiled to me right after its release, I still enjoyed the twist. I preferred the first Ninja Gaiden-style half which had the frantic action than the slower Metroidvania half, but I can only applaud the developers for trying something like this and making it work. One of the main mechanics is how hitting a monster/object in the air resets your midair jump, making for some sections where you keep alternating between hitting and jumping, all in the air. Some of those sections are very well done, but others were very frustrating because I didn't always feel in control. Apart from the nice pixel graphics and soundtrack, I do have to mention the great humor in the writing, especially with the shopkeeper. One thing's for sure, this game is anything but bland.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "23", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
