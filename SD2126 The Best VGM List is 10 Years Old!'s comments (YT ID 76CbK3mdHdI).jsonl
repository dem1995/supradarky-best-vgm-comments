{"cid": "UgwIHRAJoqLgtfReCml4AaABAg", "text": "On September 2nd 2007, I uploaded the first theme in the list, Wild Arms' Town theme. I never thought the list would grow so much and especially that I would still be doing this 10 years later. Honestly, saying it's been 10 years boggles my mind. That's my whole 20s right there! Not having handicapped myself with a complex set of rules for this channel is the ingredient of its longevity. The fact that the 2007-2017 lapse feels absolutely shorter than 1997-2007 proves to me how much time passes by faster as we grow older. I started this channel because I was frustrated at the lack of video game music on YouTube, which was rapidly growing as a platform; even the biggest classics couldn't be found. I'm happy to see the VGM community so much stronger now, even if I still feel like gaming companies or even the press are still underestimating the importance of good and memorable music in video games to enhance the experience.
