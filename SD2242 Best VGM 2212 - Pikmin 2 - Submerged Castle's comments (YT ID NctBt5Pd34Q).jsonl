Now it’s not often that we get a new game in the franchise, I understand that, but Pikmin 4 was announced years ago and Miyamoto (or some other dev, I forgot) even said in an interview that it was even close to completion. Keep in mind that this was said about a couple months or a year after Pikmin 3 came out. It’s just baffling that Nintendo has been silent about Pikmin for such a long time that it causes worry. Have we gotten no info because of the poor response of Hey Pikmin, the niche reputation of the franchise, or because the game is secretly in development hell? \n\nEither way you look at it, it’s just concerning.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Korji", "channel": "UCtLYC8I9nv3EJ8oyD1bL4EA", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxJVlHJ26HA0ap8kdVhtuMIXMaV1KbLtybjh4J2Yw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

Miyamoto was asked about Pikmin 4 the next two years, but all he said was that he wasn't allowed to say anything about it.
