Because its graphics were not that great for 1993 standards despite the first Lufia and Earthbound looking arguably worse?

However, they were very low quality in a technical sense and this game had more detail in certain areas such as the battle screens. Earthbound had still images and static backgrounds while Secret of the stars had actual attack animation. Also I don't even see how this game \"looks hideous\" in an artistic sense and saying that it is okay for one thing to be lesser quality in a technical sense and that it is not okay for another is downright inconsistent when there is no reason given for why it looks bad in  an artistic sense.\n\nAs for whether it is their opinion, yeah it is their opinion, but I think it is a poorly justified and poorly argued one. The point of this comment is strictly about why I do not believe the game deserves its hate and to try and get people to provide an actual argument against it other than the ones I have already dismissed.\n\nAs for how it compares to other RPGs on the system,honestly it is above average. Games like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy IV, VI, Earthbound, Lufia 2,etc may be the first games that people think of when it comes to SNES rpgs, but they are far from the only ones. There are games such as Paladin's Quest, The 7th Saga, and Arcana that are greatly inferior to Secret of the Stars yet seem particularly well received yet Secret of the Stars is somehow one of the worst RPGs of all time?
