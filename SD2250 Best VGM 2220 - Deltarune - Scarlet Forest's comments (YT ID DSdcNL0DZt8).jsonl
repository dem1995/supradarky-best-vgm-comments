This is one of the reason why i personnaly don't identify myself as \"part\" of that fanbase, even tho I adore the game. \n\n\nI can understand your feelings, when people overhype something it always become annoying after a certain time. \nBut the most important thing in the end is the \"game\". Not the fans, not the community, just the \"game\" itself. Which is still one hell of an experience !\n\n\nAnd as you said, you seem to feel like the game and the musics are great (and they really are haha), but what stops you is the opinion you have from it because of the community.... So if i can \"reassure\" you in any way (not sure this is the correct word for that lol), i'll just say that, don't worry, the game is not what the fans make it look like. It's  hard to articulate, but what  i simply mean, is that, if you ever feel like playing it one day, you'll be happy to notice that it doesn't affiliate with all the cringy weird stuff you saw from the fans, it's just..... a very good game. And that's it x) cringy fan or not. hope one day, you can give it shot and appreciate its worth for what it is o/ peace", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Louis Claudel", "channel": "UCnGXD6OHgo_48kznYsby2Fw", "votes": "8", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzTKbgn72tZoqL7HuuYWqjhipn0THRTFEtZbNdx=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
