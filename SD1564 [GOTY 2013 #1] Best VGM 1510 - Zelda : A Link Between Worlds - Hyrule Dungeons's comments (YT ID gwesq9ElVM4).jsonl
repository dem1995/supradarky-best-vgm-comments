After having finished this game 100%, I played A Link to the Past, then this game again in Hero Mode, and you know what? I prefer this game. That says a lot because LTTP is in my top 20 games of all time. This game really serves to reinforce the fact that Zelda is my favorite video game franchise. I still think the renting system is partly broken and that normal mode is too easy, but the rest is top notch handheld entertainment. The combat is simple but totally works and the wall mechanic adds an awesome layer of complexity; and with the mind-blowingly slick 60 fps gameplay, you can't ask for more. I also love how the dungeons in this game each feel like they're different from another, thanks to unique music and settings. I always felt like Link's Awakening was the only 2D Zelda that really pulled that off. The remixes are pure bliss to the ears as well, listening to this theme for the first time gave me a huge smile.\n\nTruly a modern classic in my book.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "65", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
