{"cid": "UgiWUNQi4pV7EHgCoAEC", "text": "I remember having to look all over the place for it when it came about.\nWas kind of disappointed when I played it.\n\nRepetitive puzzles that constantly hammer their solution to you,\nreally slow pace (Without mentioning that the super fast flower sprinting thingamabob doesn't happen. NG+ content was not very interesting.)\n\nPresentation was probably as good as it could get, unfortunately. I think this game would have been better off porting to 3ds/New 3DS for improved capabilities, more buttons, ect.\n\nIt would also mean more space for the game to have taken.\n\nI definitely agree the music was great, and the story was above average.\n\nIt still kind of felt like a huge chunk of the team behind it wasn't very motivated to do much.
