{"cid": "Ugj1FD-q7gGc4XgCoAEC", "text": "Not only is this a great horror game, it's an awesome first person shooter. Some of the most fun I've had in the genre thanks to amazing gunplay (the best shotgun I've ever used), strong A.I. that is still rarely matched and the always fun slowmo mechanic. The graphics still hold up as well. It has some scary sequences too, with Alma obviously being inspired by movies like The Ring. It's too bad each sequel has been weaker than the previous game, though I've still enjoyed them all.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "24", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
