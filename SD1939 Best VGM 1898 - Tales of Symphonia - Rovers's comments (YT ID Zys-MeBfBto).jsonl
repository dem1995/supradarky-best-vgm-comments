The problem with the port is that it's based on the PS3 version, which doesn't run at 60 FPS and there's a few bugs here and there, especially with dialogue. The bugs aren't too major, but will require you to Google if you do encounter them, particularly with hidden titles. The 30 FPS is extremely noticeable if you're used to the GC version. It's so bad to the point where you should really just stick with the GC version. The port doesn't really add much new content, some titles and hi-ougis for everyone that the NA GC version didn't have but nothing major. It also has bad resolution options, and just lacks a lot of the finer parts of the GC version that you can fix some things with mods.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "genesisSOC", "channel": "UCsGlGrA4pgjZ6bGm1kXfecw", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwpOw2F2DiLpt3jyU6tEtMJljFdkSGHPMNY9rHS=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
