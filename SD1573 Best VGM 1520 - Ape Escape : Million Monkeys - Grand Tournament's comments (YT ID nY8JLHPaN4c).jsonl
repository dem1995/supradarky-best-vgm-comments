{"cid": "Ugie-eXZzQhuPXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Cw2m70SSKDoLp7y", "text": "@***** Agreed. I've never met someone who doesn't appreciate the classic Soichi Terada soundtracks. Specifically Ape Escape 1 and 3 have some of the most impressive tracks in the actual genre, not just video game music. As you mentioned, Tomoki City is impressive. From AE1 there's Dark Ruins, Cryptic Relics, Coral Cave, Frosty Retreat, Specter's Factory, Haunted House, Welcome and many more. AE3 arguably has even more incredible tracks such as Bootown 1 and 2, Mount Amazing 1 and 2 (2 is a remix of Dark Ruins in fact), Tomoki City 1 and 2, and many more. \n\nThis track here, I consider one of my least favourites because I find it to be typically Japanese in a cheesy way. What made Terada's work so good in those games were the incredible chords, deep melodies and drum breaks. This track takes all that way. It's still good, but again, I've never seen many favour this style of Terada (very rare) to his other stuff.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "CrystalFissure", "channel": "UCyGHx-UVPPKESjSEWfhKtFw", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyqsr8HNAiO9u6Q4rbtIF8KtU-Hb_PbW9v2TbJzjA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

Sure, they give the illusion that they are (such as the main theme of AE), but the focus on chords and samples is what makes the Terada Ape Escape soundtracks so impressive. The Ape Escape soundtracks weren't really about the melodies in a typical sense. Terada implemented sampled sounds and real deep chord progressions combined with a very high tempo (some around 180bpm) to create a breakbeat style without being too overbearing.\n\nBig Mission does have great tracks, you're right. ", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "CrystalFissure", "channel": "UCyGHx-UVPPKESjSEWfhKtFw", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyqsr8HNAiO9u6Q4rbtIF8KtU-Hb_PbW9v2TbJzjA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
