{"cid": "Ugh1_1msTVB9j3gCoAEC", "text": "Of course this is my #1, right? I'm sure you all knew this was coming... or maybe not. I certainly didn't see it coming when I bought this game randomly during a sale. This might be my new favorite 1st person puzzler of all time. The base mechanics are really simple: you walk through floating labyrinths armed only with cubes to use as platforms/keys. There are 4 different cube types, each with their own mechanics, all introduced gradually as you go through the game. So simple, yet so effective. It all feels meticulously designed. The puzzles are perfectly challenging, I never felt frustrated and I love how there are sometimes many solutions to the same puzzle if you know how to exploit the mechanics. The objective is to get to the end of each level, but there's also a hidden token in each of them that adds a layer of challenge as they're usually harder to reach. The game's biggest appeal? The surreal, dream-like atmosphere which made for one of the most zen-like and relaxing gaming experience I've ever had, awesomely complemented with a mellow soundtrack. Each level has it own theme, with this one playing during the level pictured in the video. The level design is also nicely varied. If you're intrigued, I highly recommend watching the couple videos on the game's Steam page, you should quickly understand how it plays. I will absolutely replay this game fully in the future, but I already find myself replaying random levels from time to time when I feel like relaxing. And with its Oculus support, I can't wait to dive in again once I get mine.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "22", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
