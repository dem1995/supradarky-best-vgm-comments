They still managed to do something awesome with it at least, with some especially awesome artistic design.\n\nI found the gameplay as solid as ever and had no problem with the combat mechanics, but the level design was probably my biggest disapointment because of how linear and simple it was compared to its prequels. I don't think I was ever lost in its levels. The story was interesting, but it personally didn't stick with me that much.
