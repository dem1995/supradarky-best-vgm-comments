{"cid": "UgiqHsHbEzFb0XgCoAEC", "text": "I finished this game a couple days ago. The verdict: amazing.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The first thing I noticed when I played this game was how smooth the controls are (60 fps very noticeable), it's almost mind blowing really. The wall mechanic adds a layer of complexity and freshness that I really appreciated.\n\nGRAPHICS: Everything looks much better with 3D turned on. The 3D isn't too exagerated unlike other 3DS games, making it very easy on the eyes.\n\nMUSIC: A mix of remixes and original tracks making for one of my favorite soundtracks in the series. I love how each dungeon in Lorule has its own personality and theme (the Sanctuary dungeon remix in Hyrule is amazing).\n\nFor me, the main flaw is the renting system: it's simply too easy to rent everything near the start of the game and if you ever die, the intended penalty which is to have to waste ruppees renting everything again isn't really there since you're quickly rich... the real penalty is that it's a small pain to go through the text of renting all the items 1 by 1 (no rent all option!).\n\nIt's an easy game, but I can forgive that since there's a Hero Mode: when they have to balance a game, they have to take into consideration that some people don't have all the hearts/bottles/hidden equipment. As I said on twitter, it'd be like balancing an RPG around the players who hit lvl 99. Of course it's easy if you get everything, and that's where Hero mode comes in (hopefully). Personally, I like to never use any of my bottles (fairies/potions) which makes it quite harder. I also ended up doing the Swamp Dungeon last, which has a great piece of equipment, making the rest of the game quite harder.\n\nWell done Nintendo, well done.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "61", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

{"cid": "UgiqHsHbEzFb0XgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-5MM77-IpOf7PJvN", "text": "@***** @David Silbert As they explained in the Iwata Asks (a great read, recommended!), and as I've experienced and seen for myself - the Zelda formula makes a LOT of the not-so-hardcore players get stuck. Either a puzzle is too hard, or a boss is, or they're just missing something that's right in front of them, but at some point in every Zelda game, most players get stuck and then they don't have any way to keep playing. It happens to me a lot too, in Ocarina of Time 3D (never played N64) I didn't notice that I could move the gravestones. Eventually I gave up and looked up a walkthrough... It was so frustrating to realize THAT was what stopped me from continuing. So think of all the people who just GAVE UP instead of looking up a walkthrough.\n\nSo with this rental system, if you get stuck in one dungeon, it doesn't stop you from continuing the game in other dungeons. Zelda games are always great at giving the illusion that they're not linear, when really they're as linear as it gets. Sure, you can mess around with side-quests or minigames, but in order to complete the game you have to do the dungeons in a certain order and there's no other way about it. By allowing players to give up on a certain dungeon and go do other things (other dungeons), they're allowing those players to come back to the dungeon later with more equipment, and a refreshed mind.\n\n[[warning - rambling]]\nIf I get stuck in a game and can't continue, my mind obsesses about that part specifically every time I think of the game. Eventually when I approach it again, I come back with the same thoughts I had the first time, which have persisted since. I remember exactly what is where, and expect to see the same thing, therefore I don't notice anything new that I didn't notice the first time. If I can see other parts of the game, it lets me completely forget about the stuck area, so the next time I'm there I can examine it as if it's new to me, likely seeing what I missed the last time.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "NeatNit", "channel": "UCjM2OgFmEWzL_6Yvef7I4fA", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyZvk_zayh9RHprZPC20P5s3IC_B9Fh1uVpnM7C=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
