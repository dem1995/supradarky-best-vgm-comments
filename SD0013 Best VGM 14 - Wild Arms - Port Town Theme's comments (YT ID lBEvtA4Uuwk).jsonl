They have been very vocal about a new entry for the past 4 years now, if I ever see Sony investing in a tons of JRPGs by themselves again I would think they waited for better hardware and possibilities to revive the genre. It was on a decline last gen with FF didn't changed, DQ was on handheld only, Hironobu Sakaguchi tried with Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey but no one was that excited for the same formula we have already seen in the PS2 era. It was for the best we skipped on one generation for JRPGs. FF is finally having a big change since FF7 with 15, Yakuza 6 is seamless (actually action/adventure but still), Star Ocean 5 is seamless, action RPG is experimenting and turn-based have been surpassed by Dragon's Dogma and Monster Hunter. Action RPG is not the basic gameplay we've seen in Star Ocean and KH, it can do a lot more now with the hardware we have now.
