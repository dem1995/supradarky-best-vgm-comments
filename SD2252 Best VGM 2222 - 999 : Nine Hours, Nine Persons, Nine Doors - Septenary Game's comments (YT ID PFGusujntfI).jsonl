In 999 it was pretty brutal to have to replay the beginning so many times, and really prevented you from experimenting properly - or at least from doing so enjoyably.\n\nI can say that personally I couldn't get any of the interesting endings without a walkthrough of some sort. The game doesn't give you enough feedback for whether or not you're on the right track.\n\nFrom a story perspective, I can see where you're coming from, and the 999 story did feel a lot more personal and straightforward than VLR.
