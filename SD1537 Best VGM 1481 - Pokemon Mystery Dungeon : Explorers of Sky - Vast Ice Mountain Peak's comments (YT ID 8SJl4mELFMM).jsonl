{"cid": "UgjQG3N3dI5B43gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-IfJC7-HGidP6zti", "text": "(Alright, time to fill in for SD...)\nTo me, the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series (or, the two that I've played: Red Rescue Team and Explorers of Time) just feels kind of... Bland. Even though it's nostalgic. I like the randomly generated dungeons, but it feels like that's it. The side quests felt like chores, and after a while, going through dungeons and 1-hitting everything with the overpowered Pokemon you control and your overpowered partner, with one or two underleveled Pokemon behind you most of the time, felt repeditive.\nThere are many aspects of the series that I like, but they're only the consepts; things that can work in theory, but are poorly executed. Anyone remember that one area in Explorers of Time/Darkness/Sky called (eeh, I can't remember, maybe) Silent Chasam, where all the walls were replaced with an abyss and Flying Pokemon could attack you from all sides? That's what I want to see more of, more ways that the base mechanics can be mixed up. Instead, they stuck with the same repeditive go-from-point-A-to-point-B and fight some stuff along the way, when they could have done so much more.\nOf course, the things that I really like about it: The story is memorable (although, I hate how they reuse the ending for the first game, the \"I'm going back to my world\" thing) and of course, I love the music, the \"to the forbidden land\" track being one of my favorites.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Jirt", "channel": "UCE-dsUNjcD8hQyiyxfvu2mg", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJylkHX8alswF9JDpe2_b5XHqDtkCupgpiqB3wI7=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
