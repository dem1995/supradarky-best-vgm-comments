{"cid": "UgxA0sIVyrvYJMpV1tB4AaABAg.8GckIShk2In8PUQ86Oe0_V", "text": "Nostalgia plays a part in everyone's life, and for many this was their first Final Fantasy. However, it was also perhaps one of the more surreal. While all the PSX era games had static, pre-rendered backgrounds, I'd argue that this game had perhaps the most colorful, unique, and creative of the bunch. Forgotten city was so mysterious in its looks, the song only compounding such a bizarre location (what the shit lived in that giant conch?!). The very sound of the OST had such a unique flare, perhaps due to restrictions, giving it a more artificial, if unnatural sound other Square rpgs had at the time (Legends of Mana!) which in my opinion made the experience all the more enthralling. \n\nThe world map had a grey tint to it by the end, with the somber music and the fact the world was ending all fit so perfectly together, like many things did. (other ff games did this too, even 6 before it, but still it worked!) Everyone will have their favorites, but this game did a lot of things right at the right time, from unique characters like Red XIII, to the bizarre enemies that covered the world. As others said above me, this game brought JRPGs to their countries, that wasn't by mistake.\n\nFinal Fantasy 6 is perhaps one of my favorites, and I can understand people hating on 7 after the shift from sprites(or believing others loved the game simply because it was 3d, even if characters looked pretty bad and it always bothered me that they had no mouth) but even with the weak push when it came to the polygons.. the background, atmosphere, and many mechanics just worked and elevated it from such faults to the point where I could forgive it\n\n It's not all nostalgia, and I'd disagree when you say it isn't the best \"By a long shot\", because I'd put it right up there with 6, 8, 9, and Tactics, which perhaps had one of the best stories imo. Strange, pre-rendered machinery filled several backgrounds, ghosts in the abandoned train-yard, the swinging guillotine guys in the abandoned mansion.. the thrill of finally climbing the Shinra tower... finding Lucrecia's Cave... looking for that damn key item at the dig site. All of it just created a strange, yet unforgettable world later games just didn't do the same (though don't get me wrong, they did things in their own way, and did it quite well). The setting of the game opened up so many possibilities for uniqueness that they used. The other games setup a very specific theme and stuck with it, it was less of a mess and more direct, which is fine, but 7 kept that perfect blend of fantasy and technology that 6 was pushing as well, while at the same time being sloppy, yet surprisingly well kept. \n\nTLDR: It just saddens me when I see comments like this when it truly boils down to ones own opinion, and what they got out of their experience with this, and any other game. I've played every Final Fantasy (except 12) Yes, even 11 and 14 quite passionately, we're not all blind by nostalgia when there is truly something to enjoy. Frankly, you're making it seem like you simply know something everyone else doesn't, but it doesn't quite work that way. I spent just as many hours in 8, 9, and 10 as I have in 7, each a big part of my life. Opinions.\n\nWe know what we like, and I'd put 7 right up there even with its lacking story, the comical villain that was Sephiroth, and the disgusting yet silly character of Don Corneo.. why? Because the game is fun, and that's what matters in the end.\n\nCheers for a three year necro.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Rain", "channel": "UCMgWMykiEMNXgZ8M7TBcg3A", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxsXZ0K2NRpNs4lAukPixJkK0ZgrFhFEdc8vLi3=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
