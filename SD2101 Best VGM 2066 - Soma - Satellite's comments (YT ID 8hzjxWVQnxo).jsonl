{"cid": "UghOCkh52MR_-HgCoAEC", "text": "I finished this game last week and what a ride it was. As a fan of Penumbra and Amnesia, I was excited to play the game but it was mainly because I was intrigued by what many people called the best story of the year it came out. I was not disappointed, this is the kind of story you think about for a while, it really hits you. Honestly, this might be my favorite Sci-fi story in a video game and I'm sure it would make for a great movie adaptation. Soma would have made my 2015 Top 3 for sure, greatly recommended!", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "22", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
