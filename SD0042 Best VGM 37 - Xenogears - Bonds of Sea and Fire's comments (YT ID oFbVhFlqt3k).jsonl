Xenogears is a story spanning several millennia that involves four different incarnations of the Contact and the Antitype, heroes that actually have flaws and feel human, heartwrenching drama scenes, villains that are just heroes in disguise, visuals that most people criticize but I like more than those of FF7, an absolutely awesome OST, lots of character development not only for Fei, but also for other important characters like Elly, Citan, Bart and even the \"big bads\" Ramsus, Grahf and Krelian and a heartwrenching ending which is neither happy nor sad (Fei saved Elly and the world, but the destruction of the Zohar prevented Gears and technology from working, so the world is now in a state almost as bleak as how it would have been if Deus had succeeded in absorbing all humans), and I wish that Square Enix made a Xenogears HD remaster for the PS4 with a new battle system, improved visuals and all the cut content being an actual part of the game instead of being explained to us in a 30-minute cutscene or completely omitted, even at the cost of having three discs (The El-Regrs for example: I loved Elly so much and I wish I could play as her in her Omnigear)!\nI'm so sad Italian JRPG fans have never seen this masterpiece of a game coming to their country and I wish Square Enix could make another story like this one for FF16, or perhaps rename FF16 the Xenogears HD remaster so that Italian FF fans may play it.

The book details everything that the developers wanted to incorporate but couldn't due to their fund being siphoned to another project. (I forget which Final Fantasy took precedent, It was either 8 or 9.) That being said, even with it's hastened work towards the end of Disk One and the entire of Disk 2 the game itself is emotional. The characters and their struggles, their growth and their personal demons that they need to overcome. While some get a smaller demon to face (In relation to Rico and Billy) Others have long term and much more character defining ones.

The game is such an impressive combination of jaw-dropping and original stuff that it's extremely hard to find something else that even come comes close to it. Of course it's a stretch to say it's the best game ever, but this would be true for anything and any game. A book has been published after the game came out, titled Xenogears: Perfect Works, which explain a lot of the universe the designers had created for the game. This alone gives a feeling of how well thought-out the game has been. Personally, the perfect combination of the thought-provoking and mature story, plot, narrative and music are what creates this killer game.
