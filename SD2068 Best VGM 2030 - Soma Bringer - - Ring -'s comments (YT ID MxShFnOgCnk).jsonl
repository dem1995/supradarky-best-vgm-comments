{"cid": "UgilYHeHyz3d2HgCoAEC", "text": "I haven't played this game by Monolith as it wasn't released outside of Japan (a translation does exist though!), but I wonder if it feels a bit like a Xenoblade-lite with its open spaces and action RPG elements. It certainly looked interesting. The first trailer I watched back then had this theme playing and it made me really excited. Unfortunately, the singer Eri Kawai died shortly after this game released... she had a beautiful voice.", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "17", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
