{"cid": "UgwEZNxAllOTt3fvdSl4AaABAg", "text": "This is a game I played strictly because of all the praise I read, it really wasn't on my radar. Boy am I glad I played it, this game while not perfect is very close to being a masterpiece in my book, and I wouldn't be surprised if it did end up becoming one as time passes and I reflect on it. My biggest advice is to go in completely blind, all you need to know is that the game resets every 22 minutes with the sun exploding and ending the world. During this 22 minutes loop, each planet you can visit has its own \"schedule\" of events and it's that sense of slowly understanding what is going on and how everything is connected that is mind blowing. I actually did not enjoy my first few hours with the game because it was frankly overwhelming and I felt like I was not making any progress. But then it clicked and the ship's system keeping a journal of your progress even through the loops gave me that sense of progression that I needed. It felt like there were 100 pieces of the puzzle and finding only a few of these pieces per loop was a bit discouraging at first, but the saying \"slowly but surely\" absolutely defines the experience. This is one of the most memorable game I've ever played, truly.", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "31", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
