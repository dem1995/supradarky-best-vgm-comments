{"cid": "UgjgIbdJMOC50XgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-Gr477-HqW5jDhjj", "text": "Hello SD! Nice song again. May I suggest some albums/songs? I think your list really needs some Unreal songs from the very first Unreal. The game and the soundtrack both could be described as ”highly atmospheric”. OST is composed mainly by Alexander Brandon & Michiel van den Bos! I recommend \"Shared Dig\" and \"Hub 3 (Spire)\", but the whole soundtrack is truly awesome and in my opinion deserves a place on your list.\n\nRogue Legacy has some cool songs (\"Whale. Shark.\" for example) and the game itself is cool too. Also, Age of Empires II has a very nice soundtrack. More JRPG songs would also be nice (Ni No Kuni field theme maybe?).  Personally MegaDrive/Genesis songs are always welcome. For example Bio-Hazard battle has kind of funky and ”alien” songs.\n \nI recently started to play Valkyrie Profile 2 and noticed that the series composer is the one and only Motoi Sakuraba. Can’t say anything about the music yet, though. Have you played it (or listened to its soundtrack), Supra? To me Sakuraba has been kind of disappointing lately (because of Tales of Graces F & Tales of Xillia)\n \nSorry for the long post. Honestly it expanded kind of accidentally. I mainly wrote this because of the Unreal songs so I hope that you listen to its soundtrack or at least those two songs if you’ve time. I’ve enjoyed your playlist for many years and quality is still as high as about 1500 songs before, so keep it going!", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Kage Takashi", "channel": "UCQPswf7f0qoK09aoTEb0tKw", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyBlMmQQNz1NZOyisNLLuaevxSWdSomimXaHYLK=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
