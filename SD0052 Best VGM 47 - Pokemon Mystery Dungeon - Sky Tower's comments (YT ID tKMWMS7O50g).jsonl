The difference is like playing a cd vs having a musician sit in front of you and play off of sheet music; the instrument is a pre-programmed sound that's part of a \"soundfont\", the system itself is the musician, and the sheet music tells the musician how to play the song in real time. Because all you need to save are the \"instruments\" and \"sheet music\" the actual complex audio data that makes files like mp3 so big can be safely ignored, allowing you to get more bang for your buck in terms of storage.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the amount of songs and their length are still impressive, but your comment seems to imply you think it was because of hardware storage limitations (for context, some guy ripped the midis for the sequel Explorers games and they come out at around 1.30 mb in size: https://psycommando.tumblr.com/post/105768826462/pok√©mon-mystery-dungeon-explorers-of-sky-full )", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "Atomic Robo Tesla", "channel": "UC96Mib16WVE4ybp6C62cQSQ", "votes": "11", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxKfgcX1JJBAjQHn-GwkLSVpw9AnCVD_sv8gg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

Dialga/Palkia battle theme (diamond/pearl)\n3. Temporal Tower (PMD2)\n2. Dialga's Fight to the Finish (PMD2)\nThose 2 sound very similar but i think it's still important to separate them from each other because dialga's fight to the finish is extremely powerful and great because of that but temporal tower is so deep and emotional. when it starts playing after grovyle's death you feel like you're flying through the dungeon and that there's just no way to fail.\nAnd the top step would go to sky tower as i said. this is so great. it's just complete. it has everything. the game came out 10 years ago and i'm still listening to it regularly. just incredible! it gives you hope, gives you that \"one last time\" or \"let's finish this\" feeling but has still such a great rhythm that you want to dance to it.\nbut of course 5 songs are far too few to acknowledge all the great pokemon soundtracks out there. even in the first mystery dungeon i could give you about 10 to 15 that are absolutely awesome. but as i said if i had to break it down to 5 these would be in it.\nBTW have a look at the \"dialga's fight to the finish remix\" on the channel of LOrbSheddy. it's the best remix out there in my opinion :)", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "PRO kuZi", "channel": "UCwlBV-EwsYSvUenUbvux-EQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxKPOSRfQ1zYQiuNMcgDN5zau9m4AsSZObAyg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

It's incredible how at first listen it sounds very happy and joyful, but following the story, it carries a much deeper, somber note that just played with my emotions time and time again. The idea that you and your best friend were to venture where no one else could, to the sky, where you knew very well that it could be your last adventure, and that your return mattered not, was incredibly powerful. If you succeeded, the world continues. You and your best friend must save the world, at your own loss, and you know you won't make it back. To this day every time I listen to it, I remember the amount of times I had to repeat the dungeon to beat Rayquaza, but also that I didn't mind, because it gave me another opportunity to hear its fantastic music. I will admit that the first few times, it made me tear up, but I truly appreciate the incredible emotional influence that the story and track evoke. This soundtrack is simply magnificent.
