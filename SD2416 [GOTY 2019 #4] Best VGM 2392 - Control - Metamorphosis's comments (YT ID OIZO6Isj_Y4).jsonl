{"cid": "UgxxBSp0od0UHPk0nMt4AaABAg", "text": "I've always been a big fan of Remedy's Max Payne and Alan Wake games, so it comes as no surprise that Control is one of my favorites of 2019. It might actually be my favorite Remedy game ever, and that's in big part due to the awesome gameplay and paranormal stories found inside the Federal Bureau of Control (also known as The Oldest House). I went in blind and I had no idea the game had an open Metroidvania structure; it's definitely a positive for the game but the bad map system makes traversal much more of a pain than it should be, especially when you can stumble upon waves of enemies while you're looking for the right place to go. The mix of gun gameplay and powers which include telekinesis and levitation make for greatly entertaining battles, though the difficulty can be slightly unbalanced with some spikes. The game feels like I was playing a big episode of X-Files and I loved to learn about these Altered Items: for example there is a fridge that kills you as soon as you stop looking at it, so they have people on shifts just to sit in front of it and look at it. Or there's a clock that multiplies itself constantly. It's just really fun. It's also helped by the fact that the head Researcher Dr. Darling is my favorite character of the year. This is an awesome game and I'm excited for the DLCs.", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "22", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
