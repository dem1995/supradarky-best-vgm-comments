The meaningful story about Madeline dealing with her depression/anxiety was also a central part of the game and I know it resonated with a lot of people. It's made even more thought provoking when you learn that the developer himself had to face that battle during the game's development and decided to give what was to be simply a challenging platformer such a metaphor.
