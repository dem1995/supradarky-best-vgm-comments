My only complaint is that it felt a bit short for a point and click game, only taking me about 5 hours or so. But that was 5 of the best hours ever! This is now my second favorite point and click game, behind \"Where in Time is Carmana Sandiago?\" I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves artsy game and point and click games.
