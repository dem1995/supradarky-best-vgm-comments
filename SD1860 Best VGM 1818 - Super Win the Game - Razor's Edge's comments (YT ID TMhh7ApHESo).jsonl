The game flew under the radar, but I really enjoyed my time with its semi-open world and branching paths, obviously getting inspiration from Zelda II and other classic platformers.

As others already mentioned it's well deserved!\nI may be wrong about this, but due to the fact you randomly downloaded a game from the Stream library and that there have been a lot more uploads from newer games since you took your break, I've been getting the impression that you have more time to play videogames recently. Did I get a wrong impression or is that actually true?\nTalking about a lot of time to spend on videogames, I'm curious: you've mentioned in your 1756th entry that Xenoblade Chronicles would be your big summer game for this year. Since you were probably really busy this summer, did you manage to play it? I'm currently doing so myself, but I'm very busy aswell so I've been playing it for almost three months now.\nThanks for taking the time to read this long comment. It ended up a lot longer than I thought  it would. Also thank you for this great list, I've been enjoying it a lot even though I usually don't comment on your uploads.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Julian", "channel": "UCX3v9xFq3c6FKIX_Soqalkg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxrpulrt8CJdoI9LL25-zGqQRg4T7ELtss0-bEC=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
