I remember when my PSX was suddenly seeking on the CD and a song started, which meant I reached a key point in the level.\n\nI remember one specific week in my childhood, the week after I asked my parents for a PSX (instead of a N64, changed at the last minute when I tried twisted metal 2 at a demo booth) we went to a video store that was far away of our home since we did not have any PSX games to rent nearer. The 2 games I rented, without having read any reviews or heard about it, were Tomb Raider and Resident Evil. Talk about a coincidence, renting 2 huge franchise starters.\n\nLet me just say that this particular week, there was lack of sleep and I was completely captivated by those 2 games.

Speaking of which, last year's Tomb Raider certainly looks good and I'll be playing it someday, but it seems like it strayed away from the series' roots and took inspiration from Uncharted.
