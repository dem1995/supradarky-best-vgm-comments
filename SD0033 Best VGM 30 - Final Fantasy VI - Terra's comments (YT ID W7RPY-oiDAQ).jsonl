{"cid": "Uggkpn9s-inGYngCoAEC", "text": "I have kind of a weird story to tell about this game, and this song specifically.\nI was 6 years old when I first played Final Fantasy 3/6, I rented it the week it came out back in October of 1994. Now, I've been a huge sports fan my whole life, and the last half of that year sucked for pro sports - the NHL locked out it's players (its season was due to start October 1st, a mere 11 days before FF3/6 came out in America), the MLB's players went on strike, and the NBA's biggest star, Michael Jordan, had retired. Being as young as I was I didn't fully understand why there was no hockey or baseball going on,  I just felt depressed that my favourite sports weren't being played for stupid reasons.\n\nSo I saw this game at the video store, rented it, played it, and I heard this song during the opening credits and took to it immediately. It's somber tone, combined with the image of Terra & her 2 captors trekking through the harsh winter night, really appealed to me during that cold, depressing, mostly-sportsless autumn of 1994.", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "McJohnson", "channel": "UCBoUlLKP0C3daw_yoxaMCVw", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyugGvpRqJAo5wJ7_xqCWrxgOYpNX3SIkDfAQ36Cw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

It was really in-depth with the way you could invest in the GF's and junction them and magic to your characters.  You could essentially make god-like characters pretty early if you spent the time to find and draw tons of magic from enemies and draw points.  The draw system is a bit tedious I admit, but the game never forces you to spend asinine amounts of time drawing magic.  Also, I think Triple Triad was my favorite mini game, though some of the quests related to it (namely, the Queen of Cards quest line) were a bit outlandish.

You can't go wrong with any of them.\n\nMy personal favorite is 6, so I'd recommend starting off with that one. That said, a LOT of people who started with 7 became fans of the series. So maybe play those two first. \n\nPart 9 is really good. I just don't personally like it as much as the 5 above, but it's a great game. \n\n13 (the first part) is hugely underrated, but I wouldn't suggest it as the game you start off with. Part 8 is probably the least liked in the whole series, and nowhere near as good as 7, but it's still a lot of fun. I think you can enjoy 8 if you have extremely low expectations and just enjoy it for the some of the awesome designs and spells and general gameplay without comparing it to the series classics. \n\n15 is cool.

I play everything from racing, adventure, strategy, fps, beat em up, fighting, soccer, sandbox, horror, surviving, open world mmos etc. games. I even bought myself a 5k dollar gaming pc instead of a car in order to enjoy my games properly (yes, I have priorities ^.^ ). My GF is also into all that stuff and I honestly believe I couldn't be with a woman who doesn't understand how important all this is for me. Let's say, I really, really appreciate the next gen, innovativ stuff and all but give me a snes with Terranigma, Chrono Triggers or ¬†FF6 and I will be the happiest guy in my disctrict : )¬†\n\nModern games sure have their qualities. If not, no one would be playing them, and I think game industries always adapt themselves to the standard of their current target audience wich are the 12+ years old of these days, because the 12 year olds from back then are now grown ups and adults and games where mostly orientated to a younger audience even though many adults play games... well maybe because they did when ¬†they were young....

And I think Final Fantasy 6,7,12,and13 were the best in the part when terra arrives I knew that she was going to be in the next game and I knew she would be really good with healing people and magic. And in Final Fantasy 7 the girl named tiki was my favorite because ME and her were ALOT alike.Yuki and Me had the same weapon I made the same exact one as her but origami and I had it before I played the game. Also in Final Fantay12 Me and Yuki were copied off by lighting, but at least her sister Serah was originally.But she died saving them that must've been hard for Lightening and Snow.

Instead of developing interesting characters in completely unknown/fantasy-like settings, graphics limited us now to realistic backgrounds. Games now focus on creating a world and overall narrative, whereas a game like Final Fantasy 6 saw almost 90% of its success from character development and competent storytelling. Also, Skyward Sword was probably the most story-driven Zelda to date, Diablo 3 has a TERRIBLE STORY. I'm sorry but when I saw the ending to act 3 I had to stop playing.

The industry itself is undergoing a change though. Look at the games that do make it big, all of the indie titles that have gone from games nobody would've heard of to some of the best games we have. Like it or not, the industry is evolving and changing and adapting to the technologies we most rely on such as phones and computers. Consoles probably will always have a place but that aspect of the industry is slowly shrinking due to games being too expensive and time consuming to make.\n\n¬†¬†\n@Prince alucard Imagine being a developer at Square Enix for the next Final Fantasy game. Your game has to look immaculate. The graphics MUST be perfect. Your story has to be solid and match these graphics. The gameplay has to be new and innovative. The writing and dialogue and delivery have to be soul wrenching theatrics. Seriously dude, lay off them. Being a developer company now is very difficult. One bad game can end an entire company.

{"cid": "UggeVaXTNOq1_3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-RcSS71GRflZ_0HV", "text": "@Prince alucard Okay you obviously know NOTHING of how a video game is developed.¬†\nA. It's their biggest cash cow they'd never let it die. If you knew anything about Final Fantasy, you'd know the series holds a very special place in Square Enix's heart. Final Fantasy literally saved that company, it was supposed to be the last game the company ever made. If it weren't for that series, Square Enix wouldn't exist today. It's like telling Nintendo to quit making Mario games because they haven't been that good lately. It won't happen.\n\n\nB. Writing in the video game industry has been taken completely backstage now. Often how games will be made is like this. An idea for a specific mechanic (like a portal gun for example) will be proposed. The game is made around this mechanic, and then once the game is designed and fleshed out THEN the writers write a story for it. It's one of the last things done next to voice acting. Writing for video games nowadays is like writing a picture prompt where you only get to see half the picture. It's NOT an easy task even for the most skilled writer.\n\n\nC. Yes they have A LOT of money, but another major failure like FF14 would completely destroy the company. Or any company for that matter. They've stated this themselves, if another massive game like FF14 failed, they would be finished, done, gone. Hell the company that makes Assassin's Creed SPECIFICALLY stated that they will no longer make ANY game they do not believe will become a franchise. Microsoft needs Titanfall to be successful for the Xbox, and are putting so much faith in it, that they ARE LITERALLY MODIFYING THEIR CONTROLLERS specifically for that particular game. Companies depend on the success of one game quite heavily now regardless of however much money they have.\n\n\nD. Development time is a problem for every company. Therefore you want to time it so every company has a major release at least once a year. Games take at minimum a year to develop. Often that isn't even enough time. You ever try to make a video game? Hell even a flash movie?! Do you have any idea how long a good quality sprite movie could take? MONTHS, and all the materials for that are already there and already made for you. Imagine making a video game from scratch.¬†Look at fan-made hacks nowadays, the better ones are 4-5 years in the making still. =/", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "DickVonPounDatSnatch", "channel": "UCpOUy4_ag_dV4BsckoPRDcw", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwGcz4xWyOB5IGj2cTPGTJxXEuqNYmm11jMFw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
