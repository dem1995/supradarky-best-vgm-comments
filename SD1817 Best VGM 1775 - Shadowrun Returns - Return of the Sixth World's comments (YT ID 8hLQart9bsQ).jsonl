While I enjoyed Dead Man's Switch immensely, Dragonfall is soo much better in every aspect. Characters, story, mission variety are much more enjoyable this time around.

I am playing through Dragonfall Director's Cut (I thought this Berlin campaign was first, so I played it first) I am absolutely loving this game!!!

I actually first got into the series when I played a demo if Shadowrun (2007) on the Xbox 360 and really liked the cyberpunk and fantasy elements combined in a multiplayer shooter. Too bad I got bored of it relatively quickly, but I still enjoyed my time with it. When I heard of this game being an actual return to the original formula of CRPG and top-down isometric style, I was instantly drawn because I love RPGs WAY more than I do as opposed to FPSs. I am starting to get into this trend of CRPGs because I played Gothic 1 and really liked it, now I bought the Baldur's Gate games and planning to play them sometime this summer. I also heard that Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland 2, and Divinity: Original Sin were really good aswell, so I can't wait to try them!", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "GamingNobility", "channel": "UCOVBsLKQkev_c48LIIFn9KA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwVqYebOjCQAWGB71qTS75C3sfd6Hq0A9KnK1Yu=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
