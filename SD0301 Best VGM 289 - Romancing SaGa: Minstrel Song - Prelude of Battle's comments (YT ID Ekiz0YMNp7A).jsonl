Like, I would just constantly battle monsters and try to figure out a way to make money so I could buy new weapons & armor and basically treat it like a Final Fantasy game. I know, I didn't really care for it or understand it at first either, but then one day recently I got bored and decided to play it again, and with the amazing guidance of FareltheGecko (does RS: MS walkthroughs/videos on Youtube) I grew to really like it. It IS really hard to understand at first. Certain quests can only be triggered at certain points in the game, it depends on how much progress you've made. Personally, I'd suggest starting out with Albert because his story actually starts you off with quests that eventually lead into other ones being activated. You pretty much just have to keep going town to town/city to city and constantly talk to people to trigger a certain quest, or you can look at this walkthrough for the details http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps2/924486-romancing-saga/faqs/43160 that's basically what I did", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "MegaMetalManX", "channel": "UCz8a2o6MKpaZAfe3RRc38bw", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwZbqZk1zMly1EgRcwQgehCafdiSNaI43AOnRlB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
