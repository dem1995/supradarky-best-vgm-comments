When I got it second hand for only 35 DM (ca 17,50 €) in 1999, about 2 month after it was released in Germany, I was sceptical because everyone told me the graphic sucks. But I played it and while the graphic surely isn't the very best, it is charming and colourfull. The game is easy going with easy to moderately difficult, depending on Babys relationship with you. The characters are charming, the dialogues range from serious to funny and the little comments on the side are what makes me return once in a while to games like this. Instead of making the 20th FF game (Nothing against the FF series in general, I like most of the games, but graphics alone does not make a good game.) they could recycle and remake games like this and other pre-PS2 gems.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "neosildrake", "channel": "UC1HO5yKuF174xKRJ9PwtQ5Q", "votes": "6", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwNmMIDLP1u1Sv288cJxk6NyP-AoHKLtHrHMg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
