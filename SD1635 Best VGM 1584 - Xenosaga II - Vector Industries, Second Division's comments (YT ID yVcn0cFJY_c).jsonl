Xenogears is a game that everyone should play if they love good story in a game, no questions.\n\nAs for Xenosaga, I still recommend them heavily. I is a great game all its own, and while I found it kind of disorganized, it did an awesome job setting up the characters and plot.\n\nII, as everybody will tell you (myself included), has pretty awful gameplay, but it's definitely better once you learn to manipulate it and breeze through the game. The story is still really good, and gives quite a bit more depth to some characters. Also, as you can tell so far, the soundtrack is phenomenal.\n\nIII is my favorite in the series, as it has a great soundtrack, ties a LOT of the story elements together, and massively improves (and simplifies) gameplay. The cutscenes are great, and the story finishes off strongly, and the mech battles are f*cking awesome.\n\nTLDR: GET XENOSAGA", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "VentusxBBSxSpero", "channel": "UC8jNqZnyRtNHczOsbwVklqQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzbwLV1gLvflbx-EuXlLlxuY705BKxHfbG57olu=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
