{"cid": "Ugg_aBarJtXtoXgCoAEC", "text": "(Sorry, I'm going to go on a biased rant again...)\nThe prequel to this game, The Four Heroes of Light, was a good... Concpet. It felt great for a while, and felt like it really did capture an original feel, but there were some parts that had just outright unfair difficulty, and you have to grind A TON to upgrade your weapons and armour. I haven't played it in a long time, so maybe I somehow played it wrong the first time and got stuck in a point where I had to grind, but there was so much grinding, and the game's bosses were so hard, that I couldn't even beat the game.\nI also have a few other problems about the game - such as the stats are really unbalanced (magic other than healing magic sucks, unless you grind for weapons that power up magic) and after a certain part (concealed for spoilers), you have to go through every dungeon you've already gone through before (without new treasure or anything different, except recoloured enemies), but, I liked where the game was going in the beginning.

Agnés has been a dedicated mage through and through.\n\nWhat I think is that this game punishes too much with hidden mechanics (like, you have to fight with higher job levels if you want your attack from weapons to combo repeatedly. More job levels, bigger combos.) but it is still very balanced. At no point should any common enemy give you trouble because you're MEANT to use Silence Poison and Sleep and then get Brave charges for free against enemies. Bosses however, have way too much HP, and they shouldn't have. However by chapter 3, you can with very low effort, specially if you get Praline's asterisk, manage to have your third level special attacks hit for 9999 on at least rangers and black mages. And also by chapter 3, the enemies drop enough money to buy a bunch of Blessed/Blood shields with the money from a single dungeon, which make healing pretty much free and a character impervious to almost any non-boss source of damage absolutely irrelevant to the wielder.\n\nThe fact we're discussing this makes it the best RPG Square Enix has made in a while.
