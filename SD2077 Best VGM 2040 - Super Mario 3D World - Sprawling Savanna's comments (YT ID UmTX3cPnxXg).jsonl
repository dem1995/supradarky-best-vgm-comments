{"cid": "Ugj1s3HFgmGrqXgCoAEC", "text": "Another of the couple tracks in this OST that instantly remind me of the DS Zelda games, mainly Spirit Tracks, so it's probably composed by Minegishi. I'm glad we got 3D Land and 3D World, they felt like nice bridges between the Galaxy series and the upcoming Odyssey which I'm sure will be amazing. I can't shake the feeling that Odyssey will get pushed back to 2018 though.
