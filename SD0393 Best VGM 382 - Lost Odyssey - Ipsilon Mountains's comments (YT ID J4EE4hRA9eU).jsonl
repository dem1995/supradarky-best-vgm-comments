Of all the sequels they make to ho hum garbage nobody ever asked them to , \nwhy couldn't  Microsoft and Mistwalker see this was their biggest most promising chance for a new JRPG IP , which didn't look or feel like an average \nstereotypical anime? or like a bad 3D attempt with no original depth In story , but one which blended oldschool with new In a unique epic fashion.. and did It authentically \nwithout feeling antiquated graphically? This was the natural progression of FFX and exactly where the FF series should've gone.\n\nIn other words this dosen't feel like \" throwback \" bs that only reminds you of the glory days of Square. Backstory Is all time worthy. The music Is 90's classic soundtrack level. \nMicrosoft will never be a serious global threat If they can't compete In japan Imo , and japan will never accept Microsoft unless they truly change the stereotypes\nof their console's target market , and make big budget JRPG exclusives. THEY'RE STILL VIABLE . Mistwalker tried AND succeeded here. Dropping support because It didn't sell over million on a FPS-centric system sucks , and shows alot of ppl In charge simply don't know what's up or look at the long-term potential of cult-status games like this\nwhen viewed among their own similar products of same genre. Not compared to sales or acclaim to everything else. They should re-investigate \nolder games modern potential by studying It's reverence to compare. They might then see how much It's notoriety had time to grow and foster. LO deserves a second chance.\n\nSquare never made a sequel to Chrono Cross or a dozen other obvious cash cows that just need the next number In the title... must not like ALOT more money!.\nThe Industry Is no longer developed or marketed by a gamers creator anymore ( except CDprojekt RED , and Fromsoftware etc ). \nEverytime I cross the newer IGN or Gamespot staff over the past 10 years I can clearly see that.  People nowdays force whatever games they want to to be big and sale , once the marketing and Investment becomes too big to fail. #Brainwashing", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Fawkk YuTuu", "channel": "UCe0CWhi7p1OoUn9Blioh0Zg", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxrE90Bm2Id9fKeLtT-WzWW4R0IPdxEGU54Lg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
