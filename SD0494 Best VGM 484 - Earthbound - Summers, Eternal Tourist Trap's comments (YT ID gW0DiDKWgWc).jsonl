The people at Club Stoic always giving me a good chuckle, the luxury hotel and buying all the expensive gear from the store.  Glitching the game at the museum after completing the game is always a fun romp.\n\nI'll get back to summers when June or July rolls around, as I find those months the perfect time to replay this beloved classic.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Rad Shiba", "channel": "UCJvR8fi0YxlRjtZ5xsA4t2A", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJziRELH1qu1sgxZU33shXdbKGE9ng1m8_d6aFVi0A=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
