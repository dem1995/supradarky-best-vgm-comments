Strictly as a video game, this is of course extremely average in terms of gameplay, but what it made me do outside of the game was amazing. I rediscovered my city in places I hadn't been in a while, I discovered new places I had never been to and I interacted with tons of great people while walking kilometers and kilometers. Really, the first month or two after this game's launch was nothing short of magical. It reminded me of the feeling I get when playing a newly launched MMO with everyone, but in real life. It just felt good to see so many people simply happy to be catching that Pikachu or hatching that 10km egg. It's too bad Niantic took way too long to provide essential updates, but I do see some reinvigorated interest with the recent Gen 2 update. Of course the cold winter time here in Canada doesn't help, I myself having mostly stopped playing because of that. Still, even if I never really play this game seriously again, I'm just glad to have been there and for these great moments.
