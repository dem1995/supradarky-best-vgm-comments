It's a tactical RPG that's sort of similar in that your units consist of small parties rather than individuals, each with an assigned leader and their actions in battle play out randomly based on formation. However, the tactical part of combat plays out in a traditional turn-based fashion on a grid, and unit leaders can learn spells and abilities that can be used in addition to simply attacking. Mission objectives are also more traditional, but the game has some other interesting mechanics such as units having passive abilities depending on the \"room\" they're placed into, some branching paths, and items that have various effects like attacking townspeople.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "gurvmlk", "channel": "UC_7wO34faF_aSkuQUO3vr_w", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxvqFItHuUytNtP8wJtSU6_Q5nqIo9QYeDogDlE=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
