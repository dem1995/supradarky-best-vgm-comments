Sony heard of this and pretty much ripped the contract and cut ties with nintendo and instead of nintendo getting the nintendo play station as their new system...they entered the market with their new console using the exact same specs for sound that the snes used. Hence why they sound so similar. The more ya know eh. We can all thank the old president for poor marketing and business skills.
