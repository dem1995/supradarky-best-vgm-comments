{"cid": "UgwQOUqG7A7ETB6EcrR4AaABAg", "text": "Not to bring down today's shooters, but I miss when these games back in the 90s were all about speed with great and intricate level design full of secrets. Games like Doom, Duke Nukem, Quake, etc. That's why it was such a nice surprise to play this game, I felt right at home. The 30+ levels throughout the 3 Acts offer some of the best level design I've seen in a shooter and I just love how levels rarely overstay their welcome thanks to their perfect length. It starts nice enough but it just keeps getting better, offering some surprisingly memorable moments. The simple 3D graphics only help to give you that 90s throwback and the shooting feels perfect. Pure fun.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "30", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
