It plays on the yellow rooftop above the motel dungeon, and since it only plays on two short screens, it's really easy to miss. The dialogue of the single NPC standing near the edge is interesting, and almost beautiful, too. I've never seen anything quite like it.\nThe track is called \"Roof\".", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "Chasey Failnaut", "channel": "UCwTY02Pd8sIQBOngsfxBqzw", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzUe9IlxIuSrxLeJOZZicI6l8EH3Vso1kDI2Yc=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

{"cid": "UghtON-5Z2n0vXgCoAEC", "text": "I bought this game during a Steam sale because it reminded me of Zelda, not knowing anything about it. What I thought would be just a nice diversion ended up being one of my favorite 2D Zelda clones. It took me about 6 hours to finish and loved it all the way through. This mainly seems inspired by Zelda: Link's Awakening and it also has a surreal atmosphere that reminds me of games like Silent Hill or another indie game, Lone Survivor, with some pretty dark themes. The mood of the game and the fun, simple gameplay made for an experience that stuck with me, with some especially memorable moments. The soundtrack fits the whole game very well too.
