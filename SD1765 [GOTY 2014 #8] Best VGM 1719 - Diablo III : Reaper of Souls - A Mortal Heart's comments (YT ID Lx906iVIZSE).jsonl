{"cid": "UgiZTbzPSvkC73gCoAEC", "text": "I quickly dropped Diablo III when I realized I was playing the Auction House more than anything, but happily went back to the game when this expansion came out. A truly great expansion that completely enhanced my experience with the game, I played it intensively for about 3 months before moving on, mostly because my Witch Doctor had 90% of the best equipment possible (I had the Fetish build) and I felt overpowered enough to be satisfied. I find Diablo III's soundtrack a good step below from Matt Uelmen's work, but this theme is the only one that made me stop playing. There was something melancholic about that moment when it started playing, my character surrounded by darkness, corpses and skulls. With Warlords of Draenor also being well received, it seems like Blizzard got their expansions right in 2014.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "25", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
