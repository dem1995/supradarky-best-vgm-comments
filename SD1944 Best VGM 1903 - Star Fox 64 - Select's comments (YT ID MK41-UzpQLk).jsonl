Levels have multiple exits that don't become available until later in the game, and revisiting them to get the new exits yields new levels or alternate missions for existing ones.\n\nThe controls are learnable for me; I think they're just fine other than some minor problems I can compensate for (I don't like that down on the left stick and up on the right stick simultaneously does a loop). Motion control aiming can be turned off, but I personally chose to learn it and stick with it.\n\nThere's an \"arcade mode\" that plays more like the older games, where you start from the beginning and play through rather than doing a level select.\n\nThere are some rather creative level designs, where what you're doing changes multiple times. Protect this ship from laser attacks, sneak through the force field when the enemy's firing a laser (and opening a hole in the force field), enter the enemy ship and manually change to robot walker form to destroy it from the inside, fight Star Wolf once you're outside.
