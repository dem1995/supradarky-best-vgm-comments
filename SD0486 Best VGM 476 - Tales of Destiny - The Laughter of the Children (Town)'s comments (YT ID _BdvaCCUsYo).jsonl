Sure, you can't compare it to todays tales games(I've played almost every tales game out there)\n\nAnd I still think PS1 TOD is better than at least Rebirth, Legendia, and the portable ones.\n\nAnyway, it's pretty good game even with today's standards. How many times did Phantasia got ported or remade? Some games simply age well.\n\nBTW, if you've played JP version with Lilith in the party, you'd know how awesome this game is.", "time": "11 years ago", "author": "Mui", "channel": "UCH0bfnu_SjMlTe1NWUYHHaw", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwgWQluwewQkPpIUw8HKIZn9wOOw_EM04n51A=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
