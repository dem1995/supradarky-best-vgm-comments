{"cid": "Ugjs9KuVkLi0m3gCoAEC.8KNsnR6_hV-8NZ5BXyCEm4", "text": "Having played a lot of RPGs from the late SNES-early PS1 period, I think it can partly be explained by a progression towards larger and more content-filled RPGs. By the end of the SNES lifecycle, RPGs were evolving towards having longer stories, more cutscenes, greater complexity and overall more content (more complex gameplay, mechanics, minigames, longer soundtracks, etc.). The fact that the PS1's CDs offered loads more space (initially 650 MB) than the 4-16 MB cartridges on the N64 (for comparison, the biggest RPGs on the SNES, Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean were 48 MB ) meant that there was loads more room for new storytelling and design tools, most prominently Full Motion Video and other uses of CGI. Square Enix in particular is a prime example of an RPG developer who chose the PS1 before the N64.\n\nThe fact that the PS1 came out a year earlier and the games in general sold cheaper than N64 games probably also meant that sales were considered better on the PS1, which probably helped Sony in the long run.", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "LordMyoo", "channel": "UC-sJdDVqIdMsgVycZ3UYZOQ", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxURZYHVJ-gMaSXjDPD3sGRKeyNB5zA--nVuQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
