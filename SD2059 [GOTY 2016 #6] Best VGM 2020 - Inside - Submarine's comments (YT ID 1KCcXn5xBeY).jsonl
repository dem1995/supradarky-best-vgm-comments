{"cid": "UghuW5oSt_BHa3gCoAEC", "text": "Making Top 10s can be challenging when mixed with my Best VGM list since some games barely have any music, or at least none that is truly enjoyable outside of the game. As with Thumper, you really have to experience this game to realize how important and fitting the music is to the whole experience. If you liked their previous release, Limbo, then you probably know what kind of game to expect, but it still managed to surprise me. I finished it in two sittings but the length is perfect and by the end, it's enough for you to look back and think about the journey and how it all escalated. Though I did find the price slightly too high, I would recommend anyone to play through it. Like many, I'm not too sure about that ending, but it did somehow provide a lasting impact. As for the soundtrack, it's interesting to note that it was played and recorded inside a real human skull to create post-processing effects like the reverb and the filter.
