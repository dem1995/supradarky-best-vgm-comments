If you like RPGs, it's a no-brainer at that price. Certainly with its share of flaws, but it has some very nice highs including the music. This theme has a really pleasant mix of piano, bass and synths, a great soundscape.", "time": "2 weeks ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "9", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
