I played through this with 2 friends and once it was over, I was surprised with how much I enjoyed it and how many memorable moments we had. Surprised partly because the reviews I had seen were generally quite down on the game. It turns out the stacking/totem mechanic is great, making for fun puzzles and boss fights. The fact that the engine is based on A Link Between Worlds means that the graphics are vibrant and the gameplay is super smooth. The quality soundtrack (as always with Nagamatsu) is a nice bonus, with this theme being my highlight.
