Anyways as a newbie to the Castlevania franchise I'm actually pretty excited to see Bloodstained come out. Only playing Aria of Sorrow, I'm  looking forward to seeing similar elements brought back. As for Ecclesia, I fell in love with the music...I'm looking at the cinematic intro and An Empty Tome of course. So I'll definitely play it eventually...XD", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "David Gallegos", "channel": "UCYwskSAIHyZOKG2uSThwabQ", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzVTnR5ju7qEUz1nWjOeFb3jJLnBkPG6L4ca-kpEA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
