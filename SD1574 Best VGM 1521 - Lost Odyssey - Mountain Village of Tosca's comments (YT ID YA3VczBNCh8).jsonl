I never want to give Microsoft money for the possibility of more disappointment (seriously, fuck red rings), and this game is a huge part of that. If this were ever ported, I'd buy 20 copies of it just so I could finally have peace in knowing I could complete it.

This was the game that scratched my Final Fantasy itch, obviously thanks to Sakaguchi and Uematsu who were behind it. The graphics blew me away back then (remember the introduction scene transitioning to a controllable battle?) and they're still great. The music is one of my favorites by Uematsu, it pulls off some great nostalgic chords. The main story was alright, but was completely overshadowed by the amazing dream sequences. They're so well written, emotional and memorable that I'd recommend just watching them all here on YouTube if you don't think you'll ever play the game. The dreams are mini-stories featuring the main character who is immortal, during his years that took place before the game.
