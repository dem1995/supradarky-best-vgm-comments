I had heard the name being tossed around, but knew nothing about it.\n* One day my girlfriend tells me that she completely loves that game. I make a mental note of that.\n* I find the game in a Steam sale. It is cheap enough so I grab one copy for my girlfriend and one for myself.\n* I install the game, expecting a normal Steam experience.\n* After installing, I try to play, I get a product key and a prompt to install uplay. I feel disappointed but I proceed.\n* I download and install uplay, which takes a while. I try to play again through Steam, but it does not work yet.\n* I log into uplay and I notice that my account does not have the game attached to it.\n* I spent about 20 minutes trying to find where to stick my product key.\n* Eventually, I give up and try to google for a solution.\n* After 10 more minutes through google, I manage to find the way to do it.\n* I get ready to actually play and knowing that playing with a keyboard sucks, I plug in my controller.\n* Try to play and I can't make sense of the controls\n* I go to the control setup options and there is no clear way to know if I'm in the correct screen\n* After some trial an error I start setting up my controls. I see that buttons are identified as \"button 7\". I sigh internally and try to make sense of the mess.\n* After rebinding a few controls, the \"accept\" button gets unbound. After trying to restore it somehow I am forced to use the mouse, click on \"reset to defaults\" and start anew.\n* I finally get the controls down, and I start playing. I get a mission to beat some dudes and I complete it. It's okay, not too fancy but the dificulty is right.\n* Get a mission to race an NPC to the top of the building. I fail that mission about 20 times.\n* On my last attempt before I give up, I decide to \"cheat\" and go in a straight line to the goal. I win this time.\n* I watch a small cutscene which tells me \"the game starts now\".\n* After the cutscene, the controls are changed again and the buttons don't do what I set them to do. Sick and tired, I give up and not play again, ever.\n* Fast forward a little bit, my girlfriend gets a new laptop and decides to start playing herself.\n* I let her install uplay and everything. Once she is done, she starts uplay, logs in and the thing crashes.\n* She tries for a while. Then she asks me for help. I try for a while. The thing still crashes.\n* I google the solution and get the silly thing to log in.\n* We click to start the game. Game does not start.\n* We wait a bit, thinking that it's loading, then we notice that it is not.\n* After checking things out, we notice that a window has appeared on the background with a \"play\" button.\n* After the whole thing not working again, we close everything and start everything. Now the game starts.\n* Girlfriend plays for an hour, she is annoyed because the controls seem not to work fine. The character can't run or something like that.\n* We pause for lunch, she tells me that it's been difficult, but finally she'll get to play the game she wanted to.\n* When we come back, all her progress is gone. She replays the bit and once again, progress is not saved.\n* We try different things for like an hour, hour and half. Progress is still not saved.\n* I try to google it, and find a thread in an Ubisoft forum. Other people having the same problem\n* I notice that the thread is 3 years old, and that the problem is still not addressed.\n* Girlfriend is about to ragequit and I can't blame her.\n* As last ditch effort, I check my copy of the game. Apparently mine has some progress saved.\n* We manually copy the save files from my laptop to hers and try again. It seems that it works now.\n* Tired and deeply betrayed, my girlfriend gives up for the day. Telling me that she'll play again eventually. It's been four days after that.\n\nIf this is not a trainwreck I don't know what is. I've heard that the game is good, but I can't tell, it has not let me play so far. What I am sure is that other games and other companies certainly don't give so much trouble. And this is the best in the series? I certainly do not want to even come close to any of the others then.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Hefaestos", "channel": "UCtEkK3HshA54VvBH1uyg5zw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwHlRDnrIg33WwFfmCnzUCorMcIE1ZMkwIqCw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
