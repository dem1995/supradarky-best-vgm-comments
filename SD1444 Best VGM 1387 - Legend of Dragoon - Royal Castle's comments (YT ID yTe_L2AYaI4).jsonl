{"cid": "UgxPiP9EFQlx-1PilSx4AaABAg", "text": "I still don't understand why this isn't a big exclusive franchise for Sony, I really think this is some wasted potential. LoD sold almost 2M copies worldwide, that's super impressive. This game still has a big following too. I personally thought this was a good RPG with great potential for an even better sequel. Interesting combat system, though I remember being quite bored with the game by the end; maybe a couple hours too long. Still, since FF4 I've always been a fan of dragoons!", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
