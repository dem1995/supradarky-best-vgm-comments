I liked The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess's dark atmosphere also, and it made it tense and set a great environment, such that you felt you were in Link's shoes, and I felt a similar feeling in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Now, compare both titles to Legend of Zelda: The Skyward Sword. Skyward Sword overall felt much more cartoony with its light and cheery artstyle compared to the environment of Twilight Princess and Ocarina of Time. Skyward Sword looks more animated and I do not at all get the same intense atmosphere as I do from Twilight Princess. This is to the extent that I would have rather bought a Twilight Princess or Ocarina of Time remake (or extension) rather than Skyward Sword. Skyward Sword's gameplay is fun, I am not arguing with that, it is just that because of the art style, I do not at all get the same feeling that I got from Skyward Sword or Ocarina of Time. I hope Nintendo brings back the dark atmosphere in their next Legend of Zelda release. If they do, I will most certainly buy it. ", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Skater_x7", "channel": "UCWeB0UVVCa52NNvYEiJbOKg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzYKq3IPGUPMzNvhh_5uvzQnB_Qtd4DnzmqUddU=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
