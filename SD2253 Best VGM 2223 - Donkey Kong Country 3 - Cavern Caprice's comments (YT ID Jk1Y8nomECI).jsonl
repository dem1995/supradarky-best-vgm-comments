{"cid": "UgzNOklYKU-Va5scXxp4AaABAg", "text": "While it's often regarded as the black sheep of the DKC trilogy, I truly have fond memories of this game. The mountains/pines/lake setting was very well realised, Rare really did a good job in trying to set it apart from the first two games. While it's hard to beat David Wise's masterpieces, I do think Eveline Fischer had a unique composition style that helped shape this game (and part of the first DKC). I still think Rockface Rumble (#532) has some of the best percussions on the SNES.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "41", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
