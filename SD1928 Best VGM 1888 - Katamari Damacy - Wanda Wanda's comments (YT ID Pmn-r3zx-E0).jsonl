That is, one for solo play, one for co-op play, and one for vs playFinally, the game itself...The main game would be a blend between requests from the King, and an RPG adventure where you take the role of the Prince (joined by certain cousins) on a quest to save his sister, the Princess, from an evil threat. In each story level, you would roll your katamari around making it bigger as normal until an enemy encounter stops you. Then, after defeating the assailant, you'd receive a large number of items to grow your katamari more quickly. When you become big enough, you can face the boss enemy, defeat him, and roll him up. There would also be some bonus levels that are handed as requests by both the Robo-King AND the Queen.Sound good?", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "UglySchmuckling", "channel": "UC7rjyLw1W3daHZAh7Xwfqxw", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJylzRd0quzoAt12ML7CXxFbtMjIE8hiAlTxLw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
