It didn't need more characters, it just needed more unlockable characters (and Lucas). Also, the new stages are a little painful to think about, if I may say so myself. Regardless, I really enjoyed the musical selection in this game. My personal favorite remixes are Gerudo Valley, Gear Getaway, Rainbow Road Medley, and N's Castle.

Melee and Brawl both had massive hidden rosters, and it gave those games a satisfying sense of progress and accomplishment, which is something that I welcome in a game that otherwise has very little long term goals, not counting collect every trophy and unlock every achievement. Ideally, and this is just my opinion, the starting roster for any Smash game would be either the original eight or just the returning fighters, and every other character would have to be unlocked.\n\nOf course, and I forgot to mention this in my original post, the one part of this game that really bugs me above all else is the fact that I have to shell out my hard earned coins to even be given the option to attempt Classic mode.
