Kind of absurd though, with such a high amount of songs in the series (over 1940), you'd think great famous tracks like these have been in the playlist for years. There's a big gap between this SOR2 song and the previous one (which is number 1471), just goes to show that there's tons of video games with great soundtracks and how even with such high number of tracks you still can be missing the classics (if I can call so songs like SOR2's dreamer). \nOn a bit of unrelated note, I know you've played Live-a-Live, but It's mind-boggling (to me at least) how you haven't added Megalomania as a Best VGM. It's so blood-pumping and amazing, one of my favorite video game tracks for sure.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Happytreefriendsfan3", "channel": "UCO4RJgRoVtoegySP4zx8Sbg", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzx9ap5y7oA2fv5tCKoFq2g-HfFFNMDfzJ7JA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
