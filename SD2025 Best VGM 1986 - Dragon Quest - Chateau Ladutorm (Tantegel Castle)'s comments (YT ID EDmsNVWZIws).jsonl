{"cid": "UggUzPNpwWF9ZXgCoAEC", "text": "This game changed and revitalized the RPG genre back then, and in the process the video game industry as a whole. It became the JRPG template. The game's success in Japan is actually what made Square greenlight Final Fantasy as they initially refused to give Sakaguchi permission to create it. I've already said many times how big a fan I am of this series, with its \"comfort food\" type of gameplay you always come to expect, so I'm quite excited for DQXI. I'm glad to see DQVII 3DS and Builders be nicely successful outside of Japan. It's also fun to remember that Chunsoft, and not Enix who was only the publisher, was behind the first 5 Dragon Quest games.
