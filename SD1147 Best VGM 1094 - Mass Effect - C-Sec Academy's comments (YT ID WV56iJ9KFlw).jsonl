You don't care as much about story telling, quality of writing, lore or character consistency, tone shifting, thematic device and the disavowing of it over the course of a trilogy, etc. That's cool.

I was only stating my opinion, I never said \"This is objective fact, quote me on this\" I was just giving my take. That's part of what makes a comment section interesting, people giving their opinions on the video or something relevant to that video. Your take is different, that doesn't anything I said.
