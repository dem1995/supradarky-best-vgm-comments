I went to a friend's house last week and he showed a couple parts and the size of the world, how dense it is and the number of things you can do is mind boggling. He also showed me a few minutes of the Hyrule Castle as he was about to go fight Ganon and hearing this theme was amazing. Honestly, this raises a new bar for Open World games and I wonder how other developers will react to prevent their own games in the genre from feeling bland.

BotW is not only completely non-linear, but it also gives the player a lot of freedom in their own play style. I know a lot of people who played it, and everyone played it in different ways. One did a lot of sidequests, one rushed directly to dungeons, one did not use potions and food so that battles got harder, etc. I feel like BotW will revolutionize the open world genre.
