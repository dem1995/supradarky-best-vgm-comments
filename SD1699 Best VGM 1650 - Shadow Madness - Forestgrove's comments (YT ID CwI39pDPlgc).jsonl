The gameplay is truly abysmal with one of the worst battle systems I've experienced (clunky, unpredictable results, extremely easy), but the rest is very solid. I've played tons of RPGs and this game still has some of the best writing I've seen. Brad Spear's huge soundtrack helped give this game a very unique personality. It's really too bad about the battle system as it was one of the very few JRPG-style games made by a western developer.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "16", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

I have to say, where it failed in mechanics, graphics, and general design finesse, it excelled in atmosphere and mood. From the very beginning, I was compelled with eerie fear and disgust. The description of the plague of monsters was quite potent and the darkness of the game was fairly well presented. It made me uneasy every time I went to a new town.
