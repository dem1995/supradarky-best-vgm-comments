You play as God and it's your goal to turn his life around.\nApparently he joined a band and became super famous, but somebody started spreading rumors about him and his life went down the drain.\nOne scene shows a news station reporting on a (very likely fake) rumor about his father abusing him as a child. The next day, one of the protagonist's fans decides to stab his father and he later dies in the hospital.\nAccording to Giant Bomb, this game's story was also written by Tomoko Sasaki, the composer of this track.
