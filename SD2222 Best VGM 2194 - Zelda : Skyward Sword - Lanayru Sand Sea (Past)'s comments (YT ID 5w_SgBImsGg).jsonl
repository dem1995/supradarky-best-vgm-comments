It's still a very solid game with some memorable sections, my favorite being the Lanayru zones and some great dungeons like the Ancient Cistern. I still find Skyloft to be the best town hub in the series. I do have to admit that it's too easy and there were some very tedious sections as well, mainly outside dungeons and the horribly repetitive Imprisoned battles.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "37", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
