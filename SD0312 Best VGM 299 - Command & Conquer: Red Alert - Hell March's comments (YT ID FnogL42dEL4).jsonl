{"cid": "UgzL7M7GjAJPBj7V4Nd4AaABAg", "text": "Fun fact: up to this day, there are still people that think the guy issuing orders to his troops is a German who says something like 'Die Waffen, legt an!'. What they don't realize is that the developer already said years ago that he himself has no idea what the guy says and that when gamers came up with that theory, he just went along with it. ''Die Waffen, legt an'' is also not exactly a normally phrased military order.\n\nIn reality, the commander issuing orders is using American English-sounding vowels, if it were 'Waffen' it should have a very different sounding ''ah'', harsher and further to the front of the mouth. And the final word ends in a ''ch'' consonant. What the man is likely saying is something like 'reform line, quick march'. The full recording can be found here with additional commands: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44IZfnwokMA\n\nWith the help of commenter James Lindsay who posted a while after me and MacKingsly, this is what I think is being said: \n\r\n0:11 ''Reform band (not clear, could instead be ''D Squadron'' or something), quick march!''\r\n\r\n0:27 ''On the center'' (and usually it would be followed by ''turn'', but it might be 'dress'.)\r\n\r\n0:42 ''Arms'', something something\r\n\r\n0:45 ''Ready front!''  (Clearly a rhotic ''r'' sound at the beginning. I found this one - it's an actual US military drill command) source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill_commands#United_States\r\n\r\n0:46 ''Fall in!'' (probably) They would've done it pretty fast. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_parade#Common_parade_commands\r\n\r\nOne more useful link (thanks to MacKingsly)\r\nhttp://www.calgaryhighlanderscadets.com/training/_Archived/Training_Resource_Disk/pdfs/401/40118.pdf", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Enigma", "channel": "UCCDHyEhYp3O8_c23H0sZkog", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyI7R-qsl8bpciN_79zldFIoPUxZjoV8JsXD4xC=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
