This happens well over 50% of the time in Yo-Kai Watch)\nI did beat it though and even got Kyubi(and forgot to save so all my post game content is gone :( ) Overall it's got a good formula and it feels like if they could just flesh out the story and PLEASE IMPROVE THE CATCHING MECHANICS I think it really could compete with Pokémon(that is to say do well not just in Japan but worldwide).\nThe third one is even taking place in America.
