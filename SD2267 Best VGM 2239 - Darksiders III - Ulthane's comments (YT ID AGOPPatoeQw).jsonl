{"cid": "Ugx6I8mNXsAFwe0Mgqp4AaABAg", "text": "I was a big fan of the first game and I somehow never found the time to play DSII. I definitely will at some point. They brought back Cris Velasco who composed for the first game and while it seems like a pretty safe soundtrack, Ulthane's theme stood out. It's nice to know that this character is back as he was in the first game as well. The critics really panned this game, but after reading impressions from the players I have a feeling this is actually not a bad game at all. Was this one of those games that undeservedly got bad reviews, or is truly sub-average?", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "15", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

All of the reviews say it's nothing like the 1st or 2nd game; lacking in weapons, customization talents and most importantly the puzzle aspect.
