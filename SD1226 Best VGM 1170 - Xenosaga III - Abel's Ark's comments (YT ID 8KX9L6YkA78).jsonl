{"cid": "UgxM3VAMY3RU55r220F4AaABAg", "text": "Prequel means before and sequel means continuing. I don't know what it's called when it's in the middle. What I'm trying to say is that I want to write a comic on what happened during the Xenosaga series. There's been many things that's been left out and lots of fans questioned and wondered what happened from the beginning, in the middle, and the end. I'm not saying it's official but I would like to write a story basically on what happened. For example, when the Durandal was being assaulted unexpectedly they first showed a scene where the soldiers were taking down the people of the Durandal and a soldier kicked a woman on the floor and the screen went dark and there was a gunshot. Now we all know that the soldier shot the woman, they just didn't show it, but according to me she wasn't shot. The gun shot was from my made character who actually shot the soldier and told the woman to flee. And another scene according to the gameplay Mary and Shelley were separated, but no one knows why. Again according to me, Dimitri heard a lot of gunshots and men screaming and of course my made character came in for the rescue but he was caught in a fight with Citrine. But in the meantime Dimitri told the soldiers to separate Mary and Shelley and to guard them, assuming that my character was there for them and that he'll deal with him", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Ray Shabaz", "channel": "UCn7V9f-2v815wWeLODcSx1Q", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxfYJqDsVh1VyINWl0IjEjVUNZq2A-yvGvNx8I4=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
