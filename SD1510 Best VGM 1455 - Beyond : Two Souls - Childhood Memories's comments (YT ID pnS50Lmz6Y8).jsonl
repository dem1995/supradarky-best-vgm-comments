I can't provide better examples than this game, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain. David Cage himself said only to play B:TS once. \nIt's also been said that if these were in fact movies instead of games, they would flop because the story in all of them is weak once you remove the illusion of choice. \nPlease don't support Quantic Dream, support Tell Tale or some other developer with aspirations to make dynamic, player driven narratives. ", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Maakufamous", "channel": "UCzzn9wpUMh-JxUPubpHJNRQ", "votes": "9", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz1UFs8GCqwgTpHdSd1w9R6AyVmQ6YYWYnqdh_W=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
