{"cid": "Ugj5lr5EAMSiEHgCoAEC", "text": "I've only played Super, Fusion, and Zero Mission. Of those three i have to say that Fusion was the best by far. Super was fun but i was honestly disappointed by it. Almost no storyline and the controls are not as fluid as the GBA duo. Running from SA-X was awesome and heart-pounding, and i love how reaching locks and containing different problems in the lab leads you from sector to sector and back again to previous but altered ones. In Super it was more arbitrary, like \"what abilities do you have? Just go wherever you can reach until you hit another roadblock.\" which doesn't give a very satisfying sense of purpose to me. It feels more like i'm just running a long puzzle. Fusion really took that same mechanic and fleshed it into a believable world. There's a reason for each place you go, beyond just \"oh now i have this ability so i can open this new area.\" \nJust one man's opinion. Fusion was awesome!

Other M is one of my favorite Metroid games to date, and all the reasons people hate it are really, really stupid. Allow me to elaborate.\n\nFor one, I absolutely LOVE how it takes place in between Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion (my favorite 2D Metroid games). Also the gameplay is absolutely fantastic. I love how it incorporates both 2D-ish Metroid gameplay (which we hadn't seen since Zero Mission in 2004) along with first person Prime-esque elements. It's incredible how they were able to mesh two completely different play-styles into one game so effortlessly. The controls are responsive and fluid; IMO they could not be more perfect.\n\nSecondly, the story. I love love love love LOVE the story in this game! It gives some really neat backstory to Metroid Fusion, and is really engaging and interesting. (Great plot twists too).\n\nSure, the voice acting is sub-par, and PTSD Samus is a little less bad ass than usual, but overall, this is a really great and welcome addition to the Metroid franchise.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Moop Bread", "channel": "UC2fCpuc2pS00FZI5L1iTyRA", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyZ4EfoS5qXgE9g4rm5adUwipAeIHj4ECSyH1CstQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
