{"cid": "Ugj0Hi4c4Gq-dngCoAEC", "text": "The best fan remake I've played. I find the 2D Metroids to be some of the most replayabale games and I can't be happier that Metroid 2 got such a quality (and superior) remake to join Zero Mission, Super Metroid and Fusion. I honestly had no expectations when I downloaded this game, but I quickly realized that this wasn't just any fan remake. Everything seems to have gone through a Nintendo-like quality check, from the way Samus handles, the various gameplay elements, the secrets, bosses, the soundtrack. I was hesitating between this and my #1 for the top spot in 2016 but ended giving this #2 as it's a remake, but that should tell you how much I loved it. On a related note, I'm playing through Dark Souls 3 and I would probably put it right behind this game right now, it's unsurprisingly awesome.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "47", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
