{"cid": "Ugzk2gUvd75ZYllWKfR4AaABAg", "text": "So, what's the verdict on KH3? I've been hearing a lot of mixed thoughts. I'll be honest, this is a series for me that started very high and then just stumbled down to almost not paying attention to it anymore. I blame the side games for that, I remember being bored with Chain of Memories and Birth by Sleep when I realized I just kept running around fighting in lifeless corridors. That mixed with the convoluted story and a dropping presence of the Square-Enix characters. I know a lot of people like BBS though, so it's all subjective of course. I definitely want to give the 3rd game a chance since it's finally a new mainline entry.", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "28", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

It was the perfect sequel to KH1 (let's disregard CoM) and an improvement in every aspect. I don't think most people disagree when I say it was the very pinnacle of the whole series. The entries that were on different handheld consoles were indeed lacking in the technical aspects and had some hit-or-miss gimmicks (my brother HATED Flow-Motion and Dream Eaters in DDD but I liked them), but what killed it for me was the story. Things got progressively more complicated and people who didn't happen to own all of the required consoles and who didn't spoil themselves had no idea what was going on. But even if they did, they all, even Nomura himself, chucked up the sponge in regards to the story during and after DDD. Things got unnecessarily complicated and the stakes were set high for KH3 (in terms of story and the expected quality). Sadly KH3 was a huge letdown in many aspects which I don't feel like detailing since there are dozens of videos on that topic here on Youtube already, though its one redeeming factor is that it's absolutely gorgeous to look at, and the novelty bonus that it's finally bringing an over decade long story into an (unsatisfying) end.", "time": "8 months ago (edited)", "author": "NaCl", "channel": "UCEIzSa0ze_KWENAfl_PdT_Q", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyhCNp3yzAkR7vA_qxnofagNdVvagdQrOS3m1lp=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

{"cid": "Ugwe_sF13AiNeswj-cl4AaABAg", "text": "I totally understand the decline of interest in the Kingdom Hearts series since KH2. They basically built up to KH3 with little side stories the same that the Marvel Cinematic Universe built up to Avengers with singular movies. But they did a terrible job of it as the story only got more convoluted and reliant upon retcons the further it went in. I was more or less hoping that KH3 would be good at best.\n\n\nMiraculously however, I ended up loving KH3. It knew what its focus was; the Disney Worlds. While it does have a dreary main story that's really uninteresting, the game wisely pays litle attention to it and instead focuses on increasing the scope and detail of the Disney Worlds. Each Disney World is its own fun little sandbox - no more corridors - it's all wide open areas where you jump fly and explore. And it's the good kind of sandbox where it rewards you for exploring.\n\n\nIt has a smartphone mechanic, which sounds cringey at first, but they managed to implement it in a fun way. Taking selfies at literally any point in the game (including the final boss!) was a delight, and the idea of adding Hidden Mickeys for you to find with the phone made exploring the areas that much more fun.\n\nAnd while the story eventually rears its ugly head at the end, at least it gives you tons of boss battles and events to fight rather than primarily bombard you with cutscenes like KH2's final world did.\n\nIn terms of music, KH3's score is excellent. While a lot of it is rearrangements from tracks throughout the series, it still has its own plethora of original tunes that I'm sure would be a welcome addition to your list.\n\nOverall, KH3 is simply fun. It did what I couldn't imagine it would do, and made me feel like a kid again playing it. If the story and cutscenes bother you a lot, you can easily skip it.
