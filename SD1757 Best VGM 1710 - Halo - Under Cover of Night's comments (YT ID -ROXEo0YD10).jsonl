Aside from that though the game was fun and so was the multiplayer. The AI of the enemies is still great today (perhaps only FEAR has better AI enemies). The two gun system was also new (not saying it was the first game to use it as I'm not sure but it popularized it) and added a little strategy to how you were going to play. Vehicles to traverse large open areas. Single player co-op. An interesting alien setting and wonderful ending. The other entries would add their own important pieces to the franchise (Halo 2 defined Xbox Live and made matchmaking a thing, Halo 3 allowed for lots of customization in the multiplayer like never before). The single player campaigns for 1, 3, and ODST are top notch to me. 2 and Reach falling a bit behind though still worth a play through. The story to me never really meant much to me post Halo 2 though apparently it makes more sense if you've read books though I find that to not be a good execution for us who only care to play the games. So really aside from storytelling the Bungie developed Halo games were great and I argue that they still hold up today in terms of actual gameplay. ", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "boyblob", "channel": "UCfEjfPJ-Nhs5LJ8C23fvEpw", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwKAckB7G6ALBCtWecMNM-KIT3pshPF2HVoke1v=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
