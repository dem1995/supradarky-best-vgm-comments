For some reason, I know I very much enjoyed my playthrough of this game but I barely remember any of the story. I read the Plot section on Wikipedia and this is all it says: \"There is a villain called the Dark King. He was sealed away until an unsuspecting treasure hunter releases him by attempting to get \"treasure\". Now Red, Blue, Rain, and Ponga have to stop him.\" Now all I'm imagining is Red and Blue from Pokémon taking on a villain with the most generic name.", "time": "2 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "36", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
