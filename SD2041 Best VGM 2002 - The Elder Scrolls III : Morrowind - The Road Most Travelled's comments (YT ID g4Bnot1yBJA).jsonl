Not to mention Oblivion had pretty good variety when it came to the side-quests, whereas Skyrim just seemed to have replaced interesting side-quests and characters with 'radiant quests'. I also thought Skyrim was pretty lacking compared to previous games when it came to how varied, beautiful, creepy etc the environments were, and many of them had dull grey and brown tones that started to grate on me. \n\nJust compare the Dark Brotherhood quest-line in Oblivion to that of Skyrim and tell me the quality hasn't been deteriorating and replaced with quantity.
