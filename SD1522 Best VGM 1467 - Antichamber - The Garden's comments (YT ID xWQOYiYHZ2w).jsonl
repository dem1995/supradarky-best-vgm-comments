{"cid": "Ugjs1UpGWnjXbngCoAEC", "text": "Step aside Portal 1/2, this is my favorite first person puzzle game and one of my favorite puzzle games of all time. I post this today because it's currently on sale on Steam. It may not have the Portal series' humor and slick presentation, but I prefer everything else. The puzzles made me think like rarely before in a video game and you get that perfect feeling of accomplishment when you succeed. The white/cold graphics mixed with the warm music made for a uniquely memorable audiovisual experience. It took about an hour for the game to completely click with me and for me to understand how it generally worked. One of the best things about this game is how open ended it is, if you're stumped on a certain puzzle you can simply come back to it later with a fresh mind and complete other puzzle rooms. The map lets you instantly teleport to any of the puzzle rooms you've visited. It's a good thing this tune is my favorite in the soundtrack as it's \"only\" 7 minutes long compared to the other 20+ minutes tunes. It's one of the most atmospheric and non-melodic tracks I've added to this list so far. With a good pair of headphones, it's a perfect music to relax and surf the web.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "38", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
