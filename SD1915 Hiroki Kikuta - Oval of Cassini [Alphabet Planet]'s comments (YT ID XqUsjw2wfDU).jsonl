{"cid": "UggzC-mm7TiM5XgCoAEC", "text": "Early Saturday upload! The previous Kikuta upload made me look him up to see what he was up to. In doing so, I found his YouTube and Bandcamp pages. This is a free album he released made of various tracks he composed and they're all very game-like, so I suspect they were VGMs that didn't make the cut. This track and its bass is pure Kikuta goodness. There are quite a few tracks in the album that could fit right in Secret of Mana 1&2.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "6", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
