{"cid": "UgxwpI061_fBxBPRDD54AaABAg", "text": "Well this one is quite obscure. Back in 2014 when this game released, I must have bought this game on Steam solely because I saw it was a Metroidvania which was a rarity back then. If you look at screenshots, you'll see what seems like an indie game you would find on the Xbox Indie store for a buck or 2. I sometimes open up my huge backlog of Steam games and randomly choose a game in there to install and play, and last month I landed on this. I almost stopped after 10 minutes but I'm surprised to say that this is a perfectly competent metroidvania. The humor is very hit & miss, but the gameplay is actually nice with the 3 different characters each having their own set of combat/traversal skills. If you played all the top games in this genre already, I would actually recommend this.", "time": "11 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "28", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
