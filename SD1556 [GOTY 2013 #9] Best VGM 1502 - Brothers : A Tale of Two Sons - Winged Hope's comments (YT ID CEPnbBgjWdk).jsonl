{"cid": "UggSsImZUdedpngCoAEC", "text": "There are 3 games from 2013 that come to mind where my expectations were probably way too high after seeing all the praise they received: Gone Home, The Stanley Parable and this game. While I was mostly disappointed with Gone Home and The Stanley Parable, I did end up enjoying Brothers. I didn't really get any of the emotional connection some people had with the story as I thought it sometimes felt forced, and I feel like the puzzles often showed potential but were never too developed. What is it that won me over? The atmosphere and the amazingly varied vistas, giving you a great feel of being on a big adventure even if it only truly spans a couple a hours. The whole game had a mix of ICO and Fable auras.\n\nOne thing to note, I played this game on PC and found it almost unplayable with a keyboard. Decided to use my generic USB controller, and one of the very first puzzles is bugged unless you have the Xbox 360 controller for PC, so I had to buy one (good investment for other games so I wasn't too unhappy).
