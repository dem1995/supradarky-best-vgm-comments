{"cid": "UgzO9sbLwG6vaL7YJnh4AaABAg", "text": "I finished this game recently after putting it off for so long even if I owned the game on Steam. There was something about the game's presentation that turned me away from it, but my love for metroidvanias made me install it on a whim.... and I have no regrets. The hero being a charmless male or female head probably ended up hurting this game. It's too bad because the actual game is full of futuristic retro charm which I absolutely loved. The gameplay is also really refreshing with you controlling a flying head and highjacking various bodies with unique attributes. Yeah I know, it sounds stupid and it's not trying to hide that, it really oozes with Double Fine humor. I played its ~6 hours campaign to full completion in 2 sittings so that's always a good sign that I enjoyed my time. I heard this song randomly while trying to align satellites and ended up intercepting a radio station, I immediately bobbed my head to it.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "26", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
