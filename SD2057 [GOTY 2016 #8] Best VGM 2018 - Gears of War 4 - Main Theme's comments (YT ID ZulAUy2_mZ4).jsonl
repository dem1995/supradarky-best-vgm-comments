{"cid": "Uggwa2SngoXSeXgCoAEC", "text": "I don't expect this one to be a popular choice and I'm the first one to be surprised to have this game in my Top 10. I've played through all the games in this series co-op with a friend and we've always just found them to be entertaining and not much else. With Gears of War 4, it's the first time I play solo because I got it for free with my brand new GTX 1070 card and I wanted to push all the graphics to the max. I ended up really enjoying the game, which some consider as a reboot since it's by a new developer, with a soundtrack by the Game of Thrones composer. I guess this could be a case of \"I played it at the right time\" and that it could be seen as just another competent 3rd person shooter, but I feel like the developers went above just that and delivered a great variety of levels and challenges. While the gunplay has always been good in this series, Gears of War 4 was refreshing with its characters and humor (I read a lot of people not liking it as much however), especially the father and son interactions. It was also more colorful than ever, though this screen cap I did doesn't show it. Simple, great fun that actually felt refreshing when I played it; nothing too complicated is sometimes just what you need.", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "14", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
