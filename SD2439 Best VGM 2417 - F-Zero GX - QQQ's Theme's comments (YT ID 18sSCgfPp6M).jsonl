Not only was this game amazing, it built detailed backstories for all of its pilots. QQQ was a scrapped robot from the future that was found by the time travelling cop Phoenix. Phoenix restored QQQ and made it his partner, and at some point he went back in time to GX's racing tournament to prevent a criminal from setting in motion a series of catastrophic events. Due to his appearance, it's believed Phoenix is actually related and a successor to Captain Falcon. Oh and probably to ensure that he is allowed in the competition, he artificially reduced his speed which means he actually has the fastest machine. As for QQQ, it's \"tortured by the knowledge that some very important data lies somewhere in its AI programming... The truth of the mystery data is this: QQQ was brought from the future by Phoenix and has the necessary navigation hardware needed to traverse time. However if its AI is not repaired (thereby restoring its memory), it will never be able to return to the future.\" There are 41 pilots in this game.", "time": "2 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "25", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
