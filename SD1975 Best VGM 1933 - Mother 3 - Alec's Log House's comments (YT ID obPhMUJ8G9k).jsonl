{"cid": "UggQxTiSFp7HP3gCoAEC", "text": "Mother 3's soundtrack just doesn't hold a candle to Earthbound's, mainly because (outside of the battle themes) it's a bunch of remixes of a few themes. It's also shorter and I liked traveling around the world more than staying on one island in the middle of nowhere.\n\nAll that aside, it's a damn good game in its own right. It's funny like its predecessor in spite of being far more bleak.
