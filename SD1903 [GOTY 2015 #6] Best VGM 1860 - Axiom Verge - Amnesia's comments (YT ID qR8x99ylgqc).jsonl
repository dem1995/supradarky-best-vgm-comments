{"cid": "Ugim2HtY-oK3bXgCoAEC", "text": "As a huge Metroid fan, I was extremely hyped for this game when it was announced. While it didn't completely meet my lofty expections, I still had a blast playing it. The HD pixel graphics are super impressive, smooth and vibrant. The soundtrack is quite unique and well composed, though I only found a couple themes truly memorable. The sound effects are top notch. The weapon variety is huge, but unfortunately 80% of the guns feel completely useless. The atmosphere is a highlight and the world is very big. Some mechanics like teleporting through walls simply feel awesome to use. But there were definitely some negatives for me: the controls could be better (a higher jump is never as good as a double jump, the grappling hook is hard to master until you don't even need it anymore, shooting the gun in the right direction can feel clumsy), the huge map has no teleportation system and has too many vertical corridors. A lot of corridors in general feel completely empty, as if it took too much inspiration from the first Metroid which did that due to RAM restrictions. Still, the overall package is mighty impressive especially when you know it's all made by 1 person. Oh, and another highlight is the drone you can control, loved that!", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "32", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
