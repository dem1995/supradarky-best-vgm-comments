{"cid": "UggAtxlwyANktHgCoAEC", "text": "After 120 hours of doing sidequests, wandering the lands and scavenging materials, I was satisfied enough to go through the final missions and be done with this game. Fallout 4 is a great game, but I just can't shake the feeling that it could have been much more and much better, enough for it to be my favorite game of the year and one of my favorites ever. As it stands, it's a great, immersive game with a huge world and Bethesda did a superb job with their vision of a post-apocalyptic, retro futiristic Boston. The gun gameplay is quite a step up from the previous games and how the skill system works is interesting, eventhough I found most of the skills boring in their design. The game just oozes atmosphere, great audiovisuals making it easy to get lost into it. There's also some world building you can do, but I have to say I didn't have any interest in that. I did see some amazing things from other people on the net. The story is a definite weak point due to the amateurish, almost laughable writing and dialogue options (illusion of choice). Some of your companions are great (Piper, Deacon, Curie, Valentine come to mind), but their AI is terrible which often made me consider playing solo. Only a few quests are memorable since there's a lot of \"kill X\" or \"fetch X\" missions. There's a huge amount of buildings and sites you can visit, but a lot of them are way too similar, so I found the exterior world much more interesting. The inventory system is a disaster to go through and choosing the right equipment is made tedious by the lack of comparison stats with your currently equipped stuff. The lack of polish is almost expected with Bethesda, but the fact that Fallout 4 played it so safe in other departments means that they should have been able to spend extra time on polish. It's funny because I feel like I'm being very down on this game, but it's mostly due to frustration at how better it could have been. Overall, it was still a 120 hours well spent and a world that I'll always remember.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "48", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
