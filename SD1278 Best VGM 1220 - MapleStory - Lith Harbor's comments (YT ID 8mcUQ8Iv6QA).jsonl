{"cid": "Ugw0696XYjWUhvm6n_54AaABAg", "text": "Has anyone played this game recently? If you make a \"burning character\" (one per server per account) you level up 3 times each time you gain a level (from levels 8/10~ to level 149). This solves the boring leveling at levels 35~+ but destroys the slow and steady pacing the intro (the first 25 levels) of the game has. They changed too much around the early parts of the game now too, in addition. Some of the NPCs can't be spoken to anymore and you can just instantly start at level 8/10 already placed at the job trainer you want. It kinda destroys the adventure, but it does reflect the rest of the game. Just grindy and lack of adventure after you get a few dozens levels into the game, as the original devs are long gone and only riding on monetary goals.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "dddmemaybe", "channel": "UCcPHs3wxxHAJnw_jmxGIgnw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-ANx25ER0toKLSrLUjD4mZBH2lIRkoEBwnD8F=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
