{"cid": "Ugz9rMdesKHSeqkQsJd4AaABAg", "text": "Capcom has been very good these past years and this latest remake is no exception. I was first afraid that using the over-the-shoulder gameplay would reduce the horror aspect and make it more like an action game, but I never felt like it actually hurt the experience. In a way, some parts were more terrifying to experience that way (those lickers!). The police station is a classic and what makes this game so good for me, but I still think that the sewers and lab are much weaker areas. It's the reason why I always prefered the first Resident Evil. One thing's for sure, Mr. X is more terrifying than ever. The sound of his steps even when he's in another room somewhere is simply perfect. He's the kind of presence that actually annoys me because I like to take my time, but I know it's the whole point. As much as it's a good remake, I do find that the price tag is too high for what is basically a 6 hours campaign with a few differences between Leon and Claire (or Scenario A and B). I'm definitely excited for REMake 3 now, bring it on Nemesis!", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "31", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
