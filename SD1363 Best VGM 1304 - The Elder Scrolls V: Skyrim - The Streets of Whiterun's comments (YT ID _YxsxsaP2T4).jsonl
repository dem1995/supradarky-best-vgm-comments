A lot of bland and anticlimactic questlines, seemingly fewer side-quests than Oblivion, but we did have a lot of 'radiant AI' bullshit where you could do the same 'kill bandit' quest over and over. Only this time he's in a different dungeon! Well... different... I mean one that has the same puzzles and Draugr and no interesting loot. Have fun! Oh, and no magic crafting for you... or class building.\n\nThe environments (the ones including foliage anyway) looked like a green soup with a lot of brown tints. Even fire seemed rather pallid. It's like a dull filter was laid over the screen compared to Oblivion, and the environments weren't very varied. Many places looked too much alike. \n\nIt just felt like Skyrim was to Oblivion what Fallout 4 was to Fallout 3. Less depth, more 'polished' and shiny. And it's not like Oblivion was deep either.
