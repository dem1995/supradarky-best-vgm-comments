{"cid": "Ugyxzh5Iz9G0IsiLI7B4AaABAg", "text": "I played through this game recently and all the people who recommended it to me were right, it's a metroidvania gem. The presentation is top notch, it has an all-star cast of composers (Koshiro who made this one, Sakuraba, Yamane, Kobayashi...) and it offers a good challenge with a nice variety of gameplay. There were definitely some frustrating sections, but that's to be expected. I actually never touched the Monster Boy series before and this definitely makes me want to look into it more. Love the jazzy turn this theme takes.", "time": "2 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "32", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
