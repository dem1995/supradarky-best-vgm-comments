This very unique PS1 RPG was ahead of its time and unfortunately never left Japan. It garnered a cult following. I often read people who played this game saying it's one of the greatest games of all time. The soundtrack was composed by 30+ musicians and is full of quality tracks. I find this very soothing for a vocal track, love it.
