{"cid": "UgzTu9GfvsmYJgTgZxN4AaABAg", "text": "2018 had some great Metroidvanias and this game was certainly one of them. I was actually conflicted with my own thoughts on this game because I felt like each part had positives and negatives. The story was great and memorable, but the writing and its weird terminology overcomplicated it. The gameplay has great puzzles, but somewhat average combat. The world is nicely varied, but traversing it felt tiring when you had to backtrack. The pixel graphics are great, but the soundtrack is hit or miss. In the end though, it's a game that stuck with me because of its awesome cast of characters. There are some very memorable, dramatic story moments that made me think about it afterwards. In a way, I'm a fan of this game for vastly different reasons I'm usually a fan of the Metroidvania genre.
