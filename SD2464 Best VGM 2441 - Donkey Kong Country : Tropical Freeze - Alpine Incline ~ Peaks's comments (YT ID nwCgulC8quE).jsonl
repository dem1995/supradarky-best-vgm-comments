{"cid": "UgzCIQqehdqT7A1Urql4AaABAg", "text": "This theme has a vibe. I had only played the first two areas on Wii U so I finally bought the Switch version last month despite how ridiculous it is that it's still full price, and of course it went on sale a few days later. It's a good thing this is such an awesome platformer. Frankly, I already loved Returns and I couldn't say that TF is that much better, to me it's a continuation of greatness in terms of level design. The soundtrack by David Wise and rolling without having to use the Wiimote are the best improvements, as well as having Dixie as a partner (I almost never used Diddy or Cranky). One thing though and I'm not sure if I'm the only one who thinks that, but I did find the controls a bit unresponsive sometimes, as if there was a constant input lag that I had to adapt to. Along with the SNES trilogy and Returns, this game cements DKC as my favorite 2D platformer series with Mario.", "time": "2 weeks ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "31", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
