Also the whole weird ambience and crazy stuff that can be seen happening in the background and the tons of extra artwork and music made it feel like there was more to it. For SH4 there are 3 official music albums as far as I know with some tracks that are present and others that are absent from the game. There are also some unofficial compilations made from the game files that have also music that apparently is absent from the game. Actually I think that the entire music from SH4, including absent tracks totals 4 hours.  Of course according to TP, Yamaoka composed part of the game music before taking a look at the actual game, hence the great amount of music. ", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Cenobyte321", "channel": "UCG9R51TBjmQcj2DT3UXFUZw", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwFtK4XZopDeyC08HBgEHA12nGjBGSYVwBlSDW0=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
