As you can see, it's a Zelda-clone (with constant obvious references), but its art style and humor help make it stand out from the rest. The game was pretty easy, but some puzzles were mighty impressive: the optional Master Cave in particular had a couple puzzles that completely stumped me for 30+ mins each, with me having a big smile everytime I ended up finding the solution. You only get a few items to solve puzzles, but they each have some surprisingly deep mechanics.
