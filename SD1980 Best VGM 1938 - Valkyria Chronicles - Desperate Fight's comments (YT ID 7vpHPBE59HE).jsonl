{"cid": "UgiR_CeaxKVge3gCoAEC", "text": "I finally had the chance to play this game and finished it yesterday. Overall a great, memorable experience as I expected it to be since I heard a lot of people say it's their favorite PS3 exclusive (well, before it came out on PC!). The first thing of note is the great cast of characters and their varied personalities, you easily get attached to Squad 7. You see these major characters grow throughout the game and learning some of their backstories was interesting. The story of the Gallian War was also very well realized. The gameplay itself is also very solid and it feels like each battle can be beaten through different strategies. I personally found the Scouts overpowered, especially Alicia, and since the game rewards you for finishing battles as quickly as possible, I quickly limited my use of Shocktroopers even if they're top notch in attack and defense. It's even worst with the slow Lancers that were rendered mostly useless once you got a couple anti-tank battle orders. By the end, I would mostly use Scouts, Rosie and Largo for their extra CP, a sniper (very good to quickly clear out standing units) and an engineer (great support). While I thought this balance could have been made better, it didn't hinder my enjoyment of the game. Also, realizing that I could save mid-battle probably saved me a lot of frustration. As for the soundtrack, it's by the great Sakimoto and since I've played FF Tactics, I feel like he's the king of SRPG soundtracks. Overall an awesome game!
