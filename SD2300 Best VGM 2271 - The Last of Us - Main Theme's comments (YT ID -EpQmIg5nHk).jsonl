{"cid": "UgzaiNiRFIx40r-RQap4AaABAg", "text": "I recently played through this game (Remastered version) for the first time and really liked it. I kept moderate expectations because I didn't want to be disappointed after hearing so much about it, and I'm sure it helped me appreciate it more. The setting and the whole presentation is top notch and the main gameplay loop is very good. I do think the infected were much better enemies than the humans from a gameplay perspective, not only because they are scarier but mainly because it never ends up becoming your standard video game gunfight with covers if your stealth fails. Because of that, there were definitely some long sequences in the game that I didn't enjoy as much. Still, playing through the 4 seasons was a great ride and I'm excited for Part 2. This is now my favorite Naughty Dog game.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "36", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
