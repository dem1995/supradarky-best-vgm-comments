{"cid": "UgjetKgNsXl3nHgCoAEC", "text": "\"This song was inspired by watching Adrian Carmack, the lead artist at id Software, while he was touching up the artwork on the Spider Boss in Doom. Adrian conceived the demons in Doom. He starts out doing a pencil sketch. The sketch is then either transferred into computer art by hand or it is made into a model which is then digitized. The digitizing of the model sounds simple, but there is much that has to be done before digitized artwork can be used. A good \"bit level artist\" is worth his/her weight in gold when it comes to superior game art work. Starting about 1 minute and 12 seconds into the song you will hear a musical technique that helps to keep a song interesting without being obvious. What the composer does is change the feel of the downbeat. There are many ways to do this, but in this case, I started playing the bass drum/snare drum parts an 8th note later than it had been played up to that time. This makes the music feel like it is pushing ahead while seeming to rotate or turn around. It's almost the same thing as causing a car to start spinning out of control. At 1 minute 36 seconds, the \"car\" all of a sudden jerks back out of the spin.\"\n-Bobby Prince, DooM's composer", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Metroided R34", "channel": "UCqZFqTWJMzUA5UAoSIBcxzw", "votes": "19", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwjxfS6F03mUUo3yqoqxIbNzi3Y_qYxbhMrJb0r=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

This is a game I would recommend every gamer play through at least once as it truly kickstarted the FPS genre and generated tons of clones afterwards. The level design and 3D engine were both meticulously done in a masterful way. On that note, I recommend checking out IGN's video here on YouTube where they play parts of the game with John Romero, it's super interesting and will make you realize all the little details that were taken into account to create such a classic. I'm actually playing DOOM 2016 right now and I'm loving it; it's funny how 20+ years later, this franchise can still stand out and bring freshness in a sea of boring FPS games.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "32", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
