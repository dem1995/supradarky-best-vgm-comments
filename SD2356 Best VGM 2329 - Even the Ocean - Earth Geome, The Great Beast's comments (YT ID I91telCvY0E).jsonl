{"cid": "Ugz4mAvqmYvsJXReSJx4AaABAg", "text": "I love the buildup of this dungeon theme that starts at 2:28 and when everything starts coming together at 3:40 I actually had to pause for a moment. Awesome synths. After finishing and loving Anodyne 2, I decided it was time to finally play Analgesic Productions' game released between both Anodyne games. Even the Ocean is a semi-linear 2D platformer with a story that is much easier to understand than their other games, leaving less for interpretation and that's not a bad thing at all. It reminded me of Anodyne 2 in the way that you play a main character tasked with \"saving the world\", but without really knowing the full picture, wondering what is truly going on and if you're even doing the right thing. The gameplay finds you walking around a main city hub and an overworld (old school JRPG style) searching for various \"dungeons\". This is not a challenging game as you cannot die instantly, but having to balance your dark and light energy levels make for some nice puzzles. Think of a very easy Celeste in terms of platforming. I liked how you're always introduced to the upcoming dungeon's unique gameplay elements in the outdoor levels, it feels like natural tutorials. I do have to say the whole game was bigger than it needed to be; for example the overworld was nice but never really added anything to the experience. A couple other moments or NPCs felt like incomplete ideas as well. I have to comment on the great soundtrack that sometimes gave me vibes of Disasterpeace and Dustforce. This is actually my favorite soundtrack from Sean.", "time": "10 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "23", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

If you haven't played yet, my short+experimental game All Our Asias also has some great music. Even the Ocean definitely has a lot of my favorite music I've composed. I especially like Karst Pass. The long, 4-6 minute pieces that evolve over time are something I haven't done much recently.. but it would be interesting to explore some day. With Even the Ocean, I was trying to take this approach of creating  something in between ambient songs and the more melodic / pop-structured melodies of the Anodyne 1/2 games.\n\n-Sean", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "ANALGESIC PRODUCTIONS", "channel": "UCqHkAE4NeLqeNfskowzycww", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJypvDV5l2FUGENgsAmly13IyOeD_NXmXPqQohLY=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
