Sure the camera could be a bear,  but at that time I was freaking glued to my seat! The cut scene of the vampire girl watering flowers with blood,  the lightning strikes at beginning that made me jump,  the angel statue crying blood,  jumping into a casket only to land in a underground cave,  epic boss fights,  and on and on.  So many rememberable moments! People like to bash it now,  but back then it got solid reviews across the board. I have both N64 Castlevania games and they are definitely some differences between them that make it worth while to play both and see all the changes.  Reinhardt in Carrie first outing is best on original release,  while Legacy of Darkness is great for all the new content.
