I'm still not a fan of Dante's new look though, but maybe I'll get used to it once I play the game. I really like this theme, it's surprisingly calm with a hint of sadness.", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
