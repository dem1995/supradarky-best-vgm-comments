{"cid": "UgiMOhlLt9GLXXgCoAEC", "text": "With I am Setsuna and now Firewatch, I realize more than ever how a game's setting can elevate the experience and make it that much more memorable. It's something that I appreciate and look forward to more as the years go by and I get older. Firewatch is mostly a walking simulator with basic gameplay, but the Yellowstone forest is such a nice setting that I hadn't experienced before, that walking through it and moving the story forward felt sufficient. You play as a man who tries to escape his life's responsibilities and decisions by getting a summer job as a fire lookout. Being in constant contact with his boss through his walkie-talkie was a genius idea because it made for a perfect balance between feeling lonely and having interesting, fun interactions with someone else. The guitar soundtrack is perfect for this. Henry and Delilah are awesomely well done characters and the voice acting certainly helped. However, the biggest negative I'd give this game is the ending. With such a great and mysterious story during the game, I was completely taken by surprise by the ending and its lack of closure, even if I do understand why the developers would choose to do this. *Spoilers incoming?* The Yellowstone mysterious substory has closure, but not Henry's (or even Delilah's), showing in a sense that you cannot escape reality and hope that all the decisions are taken for you in the meantime. Overall, still a great 5 hours experience that I would recommend.", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "22", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
