It was just as exhilarating of an experience as back in 2005. Surprisingly, I haven't played The Last Guardian yet but I'm looking forward to it. I know it's far from the same game as SotC, but I know I'll enjoy any game Team Ico creates.", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "28", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
