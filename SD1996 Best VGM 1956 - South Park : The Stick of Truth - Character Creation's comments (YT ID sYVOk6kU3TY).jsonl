One of the funniest games I've played with nice RPG mechanics (Paper Mario style) behind it, though very easy. I really liked the shorter length as well and felt like it ended right when it should have. Jamie's music was extremely solid and I found this theme immediately memorable, especially that jingle. As much as I do like South Park, I haven't watch any episodes for years and if you'd have told me I would be entertained through a \"15 hours episode\", I'd have been very skeptical.
