Honestly, it almost got to the point where Pokemon was intimidating me and now that I'm playing Platinum, I realize I can simply enjoy the game without trying to catch 'em all and understand all the mechanics. It's been a fun ride so far and I just got my first badge in Oreburgh, and of course I chose the grass starter as always. The only complaint I have so far is that the whole game feels slow, but apart from that it's good to be back.", "time": "11 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "43", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
