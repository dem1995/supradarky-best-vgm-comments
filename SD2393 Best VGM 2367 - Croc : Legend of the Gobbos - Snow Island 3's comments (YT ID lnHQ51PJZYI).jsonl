{"cid": "UgwhFZ58pluinrZD1R54AaABAg", "text": "It's funny to think that this game was originally pitched by the developer as a 3D Yoshi game. I'll quote the interesting Wikipedia article here: \"Argonaut Games created a prototype of the game, cited by company founder Jez San as as \"essentially the world's first 3D platform game,\" and pitched it to Nintendo. The company was initially enthusiastic about the game, according to San, with Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto expressing particular fascination with the project. Despite this enthusiastic response, Nintendo ultimately rejected Argonaut for unspecified reasons\". I wonder if Nintendo having plans with a 3D Mario is the reason they rejected it.", "time": "7 months ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "31", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
