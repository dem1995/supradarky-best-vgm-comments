{"cid": "UgwgQkv9mZiMr51nMox4AaABAg", "text": "I just started Wild ARMS 4, and while it plays great and the style is solid, I'm wondering why they had to get rid of the world map. Some people claimed it was tedious, but I loved searching the globe in Wild ARMS 3 and finding the dungeons, Millenium Puzzles, etc... not to mention how intimidatingly HUGE the world was. I guess the developers felt like they had to adhere more to Final Fantasy X's example, which is unfortunate.", "time": "11 years ago", "author": "cleomagoolando", "channel": "UCYRSiyUjz9guAsedjsp0a4g", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJymDn9fvZ7DrfdlmfeTM3dx3pH3Ky32y_Gqvg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

The stories are mostly unrelated, though the setting is the same world.\n\nAfter putting out #3, they reissued #1 on the PS2 as 'Alter-Code F' and gave it virtually the same engine/gameplay-mechanics as #3.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention Tales of Symphonia and Wild ARMS 3 in the same post, as though are the last two games I played through. I really enjoyed Symphonia, but WA3 was a much more satisfying challenge. Symphonia's dungeon-crawling sections were way too easy.", "time": "11 years ago", "author": "cleomagoolando", "channel": "UCYRSiyUjz9guAsedjsp0a4g", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJymDn9fvZ7DrfdlmfeTM3dx3pH3Ky32y_Gqvg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
