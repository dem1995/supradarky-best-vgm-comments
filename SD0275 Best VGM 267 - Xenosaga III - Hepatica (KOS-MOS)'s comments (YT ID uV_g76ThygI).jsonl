The second disk was 80% floating still images and text, and the story it explained rendered everything that happened in disk 1 (i/e the shit you actually played through) almost completely irrelevant. I have no idea why people admire that game so much; I can only guess that they liked the faux-deep grandiosity of the story so much that it led them to  disregard how glaringly it failed to achieve being a \"game\" on even the most basic level.\nXenosaga had a similar problem, too much story for the three games they ended up making (and seriously, who the fuck plans to do a six-part RPG? These people are walking ego trips, and it shows). The jump between 2 and 3 is very awkward and you can only understand the dialogue if you read pages and pages of codex entries.\nBUT, at least they are GAMES that you proceed through by PLAYING THEM. Yeah, 1 had dated and generic turn-based RPG mechanics, and 2 was an awkward larval version of 3, but at no point in either is the entire experience reduced to that of a glorified e-book, the way FUCKING HALF OF XENOGEARS WAS.\nPeople who think Xenogears was better are fucking clinically retarded. 9 out of 10 doctors agree, and the tenth died of boredom trying to finish Xenogears.\nOh and before you go wagging your finger about how Xenogears is deeper or how it's like a novel or whatever: WRONG. Read an actual novel and you will immediately understand the vast  and inevitable difference in quality  between a book that was intentionally created as a book, and a video game that accidentally turned into one halfway through because of budgetary constraints. The story in xenogears is shoddy, bloated, self-indulgent white fucking noise, and it would only have potentially worked if it were used, as originally intended, as a means of enriching a gameplay experience. As a series of dull cutscenes punctuated by the occasional half-assed hallway dungeon or boss fight, it was just tedious nonsense that should never have been released.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Powerslacker", "channel": "UCPDrb4_8QZZkd5F352K5PfQ", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzwDVrfFiYw8srq36Pt-j8dxstlBkP5_9DuXg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
