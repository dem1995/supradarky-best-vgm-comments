Favorite character is Bowser, but if Waluigi appears then he is #1. Bowser because he has good stats and Waluigi because he is Waluigi. Favorite course from each game I have played\nSNES: Rainbow Road. The only memorable track in my opinion, apart from maybe the Mario circuit tracks. Also had great music\n64: Choco Mountain. This course was really fun as there was a lot of action and at one point you can fall really behind.\nGCN: Mushroom City: The ability of multiple paths makes this course unique. There is yoshi valley too, but that course seemed bland, while this course also has cars to deal with.\nDS. Tie between Tick Tock Clock and Bowser’s castle. Tick Tock Clock has jaunty music, has fun gimmicks, and I like how it is based off of Tick stock Clock from SM64. Bowser’s castle has some cool elements and the best bowser’s castle music.\n8: Mario Circuit. Truly the definition of anti-gravity in this game. Kind of odd to see peach’s castle upside down.

{"cid": "UgiFhP9KiR7dSXgCoAEC", "text": "It is astonishing - we share exactly the same thoughts about the series. It goes down to details like favourite drivers in SMK (Koopa) und MK64 (Toad). I also think MKWii was the worst game - it was just constant chaos. The nailed the balance between racing and frantic mayhem in MK64. SMK was all about racing and MKWii was all about explosions ans annoying, overlapping sounds. I also hated how you could not adjust the music volume against the SFX. Double Dash was not as bad, but not great either.\n\nWith the handheld entires, we have the same opinion too. Super Circuit lacked the multiplayer aspect. MK7 ist totally forgettable imo, but MKDS is one of the best games in the series. I spent many hours in LAN-mode, wich basically is couch acion, but with even more people (up to 8, I think). And then it had the incredible challenge-mode which was highly addictive. I can not understand why this mode has not returned since.\n\nMK8 is indeed an incredible package and I espacially like the way they treat DLC (as you so well put it: \"DLC done right!\" The one thing I do not like is the balancing. When you are in first place, there is not much that can harm you. But the did so much right, also regarding the items. The tracks are among the best of the series and the soundtrack is superb.\n\nI think I would rank the games like this:\nMKDS > MK8 > MK64> SMK > MKDD > MK7 > MKSC > MKWii", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "BeleuchteteBrueder", "channel": "UC_rIKK0_dxDqKt8tYMdNLFg", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyT5NSPlq8gdf6-7pnudeRKnxv3xpIkBjyQJiA4=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

My all time favorite is definitely Mario Kart Wii- I've played that game so much more than any of the others and really enjoyed racing online against other players, since I don't get to play with anyone offline.\nIf I did have people to play with offline, Double Dash would be my all time choice, just because it was the first one I played, and featured some cool things that weren't featured in any of the other games. The only thing that it needed to overtake MKWii is the online playability, which wasn't available on the GameCube.\nI love playing Mario Kart 8 now that Wi-Fi is down, though the game stresses me out far more than the previous games did. As long as that remains an issue, I'll keep my top at MKWii.\n2. Yoshi all the time! Back in Double Dash I mained as Red Paratroopa and Toad because I really enjoyed their specials, but otherwise in every other game I always choose Yoshi.\n3. My favorite tracks tend to be Rainbow Road levels, Snowy/ice levels (MOUNT WARIO IS BEAST), and levels relating to Yoshi. Even though you didn't ask, some of the courses I dislike have \"circuit\" in the name. I'm not sure why I don't like them, but I don't tend to choose them over other courses. (Yeah, this includes GCN Yoshi Circuit as well, despite it being a Yoshi themed stage) Although I'm really happy they brought back that level as a DLC!

It was already impressive that MKDS handled effortlessly with just a D-pad, but now, with the circle pad for MK7, the control is so unbelievably perfect. I actually prefer it to a control stick, for MK at least, because the range of motion is smaller and more comfortable. The only downside is a fairly disappointing roster of characters; for example, they didn't use Waluigi or Birdo, but kept Daisy. Who cares about Daisy? WHO CARES? Nonetheless, you're missing out by not trying it. If you like 8, you might like 7 just as much, if not even more.
