I've never been the biggest platformer fan, but there's something about the Mario series that quickly pulls me in. It's probably the constant fun and new elements each level throws at you, making it always fresh. I played the whole game at a friend's house in multiplayer and while it was absolutely frantic and often hilarious, as someone who likes to take his time and check every corner, I'm sure I'd have liked it even more in singleplayer. The first couple worlds are also a bit too stale and easy, but the rest is pure entertainment.\n\nAs for the music, I'm glad they went with the same production values as the Galaxy series.
