Awesome levels, lots of secrets that encourage exploration, unlike the fairly straightforward level design of most subsequent titles, varied gameplay with different characters, bonus stages, items, etc. I love the chaos stages, and it even manages to tell a really interesting story without a single letter of dialogue! One of my favorite games of all time) \n2)  2D - So hard to choose! But i guess Sky Sanctuary (Sonic&Knuckles). Also this one. I remember how beautiful Green Hill Zone looks when you had only ever played NES games before! \n      3D - Green Forest (Sonic Adventure 2) \n3) So many with Sonic3 &Knuckles! I played it alot when my two brothers and two cousins were watching, and we had a blast discovering all the secrets.. i remember being amazed about the Super Emeralds, and the discover of Super Tails (since he gets nothing for the Chaos Emeralds) Also realizing how much different Sonic's endgame is from Knuckles (who i always played until i beat it with him) Also playing the hundreds of optional chaos stages! \n4) I always was a huge Knuckles fan. He's still my favorite, but i don't like what they've done to him in the 3D games etc. Especially Sonic Boom where they made him a bulky meathead.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "darkisatari", "channel": "UCIGu5om5uUU49B3HTAN7xEw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxAxd3NrquK27Ff4-JHiqKxpnFG6oVsgt2yXDVG=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
