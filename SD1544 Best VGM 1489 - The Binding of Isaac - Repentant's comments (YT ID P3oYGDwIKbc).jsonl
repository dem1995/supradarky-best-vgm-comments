Metroid Prime is a great example of this. Playing it (and even replaying it), I occasionally think \"shouldn't the game have ended by now?\" but it just keeps going. This brings me great joy for some reason, which wouldn't really work when I know that there isn't any real end. And when I beat a game I want to know that I'm done with it. Okay, so maybe I didn't collect every single powerup and maybe I didn't find every single secret, but in general if I start the game again I will experience the exact same thing again. So I'm not gonna do that. I'm done with it.

I much prefer a game like Rogue Legacy, which I never thought I'd like, but I got it on a Steam sale for cheap, played some, and loved the hell out of it. How RL does rogue-lite way better IMHO is that you, as a player, improve your skills with practice, but, on top of that, your character improves as well. I simply loved how I could have a great run and improve my character a bunch, or I could have a crappy run and STILL get something out of it, maybe a single stat boost.\n\nWith Isaac, whether you have a great run or a bad run, if you don't beat the game, you failed. There's no growth. There's no advancement or improvement. That frustrated the HELL out of me, cuz one single time I made it to Mom, lost cuz I was overwhelmed, and had nothing to show for it in the end. I kinda hate that.\n\nTL;DR - Thanks for the vid.

I haven't played in months, so I was a little iffy on the \"growth\" but I specifically mean stats of the character you play as. Unlocking more stuff was cool, I did like that, but it's still primarily random and based on luck. And my luck, especially, is awful. I recall countless times when I was doing well in a run, making actual progress, and then BOOM, terrible randomized room or item I picked up that killed me within a minute or less. Then I'm back at the beginning with little to no real progress outside of a new item I MAY or may not pick up down the road.\n\nI simply prefer the Rogue Legacy approach of your character levels and stats and abilities constantly improving as you keep playing. RL makes the game very reasonable for hardcore fans of rogue-like and even more \"casuals\" like myself, as you don't HAVE to level up your character if you don't want to. I leveled up everything from strength to health to magic to double-jumps and mid-air dashing, and those things helped me SO much that I actually managed to beat the game, unlike Isaac where I lost to Mom once and that angered me enough not to play since.\n\nBut yes, Rogue Legacy is a great game and has a TON of replayability with NewGame+, NewGame++, and so on, each one significantly harder than the last. I just started up NG+ and holy crap, hard, lol, so yes, definitely check it out if you're interested.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "HeroicPunk", "channel": "UCD_BYlP1HMAsCDlvV6MoZqg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwvElCO6vy9YZ5ht1chuqfNOoLKDGDKFIHCvM8Y=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
