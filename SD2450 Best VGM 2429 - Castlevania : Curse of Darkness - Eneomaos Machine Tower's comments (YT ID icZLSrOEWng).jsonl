It's a demoralizing world that I would never want to live in. It's a smart show that refreshingly stays away from all the traps/clichés that other video game movies or series usually fall in. They could have easily made this a show full of empty action, but here we can have whole episodes without a single fight but great dialogues. They could have made Trevor the typical perfect hero who will save the world, but instead he is full of flaws. Isaac has great character development and Hector is obviously being mistreated as a backstory for his inevitable comeback. Alucard in S3 was the only part I disliked. We all have our opinions, but to me this is a refreshing, dark and smart show.", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "8", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
