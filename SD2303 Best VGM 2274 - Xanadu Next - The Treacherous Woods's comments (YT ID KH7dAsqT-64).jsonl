{"cid": "Ugy4v7HTpnOV38_iwcp4AaABAg", "text": "A game I recently finished and very much enjoyed. Like Faxanadu before it, Xanadu Next is a spin-off in the Dragon Slayer series. It was first released in 2005 but finally made available worldwide on Steam in 2016. Before that, our only option was to play on the... N-Gage. It's actually the first time I ever put that console in my description! The gameplay is very enjoyabe and if you're familiar with the Ys series also from Falcom, then imagine Ys mixed with Diablo's \"point and click\" gameplay. This is the kind of addicting game that makes you want to do one more thing until it's suddenly way too late at night. This theme is great, gotta love the guitar.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "27", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
