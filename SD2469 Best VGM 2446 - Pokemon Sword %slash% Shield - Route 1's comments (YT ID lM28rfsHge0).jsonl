There were a few highlights (music to stow on side, and fight with the dragon gym leader among them). The Wild Area is a cool idea and I definitely spent a ton of time there before even facing the first gym. Rivals were fun-good personalities. And despite the loss of half the Pok√©dex, there were plenty of mon to catch for a first play through.\n\nIt was a fine game, really. And yet it still felt...off a bit. It‚Äôs hard to explain but I feel like HG/SS and B/W/B2/W2 is where the series was at its best. So what didn‚Äôt this game do well? Very little side stuff. No Pokethlon, Safari Zone, Dream World, Contests, etc. Not much of a post game (again, sans dlc). Gym battles mostly felt too easy (wild battles were more of a challenge at times).", "time": "6 days ago", "author": "diamondlancer", "channel": "UCMqLobXCXMe7DmKQfsgTy0w", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwAL7tACX7RPJEhWxn_BnjHrBHCORrCZPDm1g=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
