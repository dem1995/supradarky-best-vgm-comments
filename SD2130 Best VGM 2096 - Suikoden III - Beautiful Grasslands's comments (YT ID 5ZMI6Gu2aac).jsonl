I feel like the Suikoden series left an empty space in the RPG genre that has never really been filled. It's probably mostly to do with the great political, intelligent and serious stories it gave us, something that is often lacking in jRPGs.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "34", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

I remember that I actually thought highly of Konami because at the time, I figured they must be great if they could make such a great game, haha.  In terms of series that match up ... I think, actually, Fire Emblem Echoes came the closest in feel than any other game I've played recently (although I think PoR may follow closely).  It was a political story (at first) that focused on the characters while also on the war as a whole.  The only other place I've gotten this particular Suikoden-esque itch scratched is with some novels and/or anime.\n\nThanks for all the uploads!  This isn't the right video, but I think you mentioned it was 10 year anni recently?
