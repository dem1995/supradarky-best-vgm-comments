{"cid": "Ugilg31Q2a8cHXgCoAEC", "text": "Masayoshi Ishi is no Koji Kondo, that's for sure. I think I like this soundtrack even less than Yoshi's Island DS'. The problem with both games' music is that the tracks are based on a single theme (something Kondo did himself, with a lot more subtlety) that's absolutely average and forgettable in the first place. I find both games have one rendition that stands above the rest: Windblown Wilderness for Yoshi's Island DS and Bandit Valley for this game. The guitar in this one makes it very pleasant to the ears.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "37", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

It worked in Super Mario World because it wasn't so extremely apparent that the same melody was used in each of the stage songs. Each iteration of the melody was varied so well in such a way that they seemed like completely different songs, and it was only as an after-thought that I realized (all that time ago) that it was the same melody.\nI personally don't think New Island's music was as bad as YIDS. And it could've stood-up as pretty good if not for the use of the kazoos in certain songs. Not a lot, which was nice, but even the use in just one song was a bad enough impression to carry on throughout.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "CaptainManta", "channel": "UCGx_wdTqSHFAdvVvgVm03VQ", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxfbfr4LPJ7HmzyXcdUla2WOsUk_2C_PK_LbKuQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
