{"cid": "UgzJ1BgMJxDwb3ryI0l4AaABAg", "text": "So many divided opinions on this game. As someone who grew up with the NES and played the original Legend of Zelda when I was a kid, I see this as a return to form. It goes back to the open world and freedom of the very first game, along with making enemies challenging again, and having a big focus on the overworld (although if you knew where to go, you did spend the majority of the first game in the dungeons/underworld). \n\nI also felt that the 3D Zelda games had been getting really stale for me while also moving away from what I liked about the series initially. Fetch quests, lots of \"do this, then that, then that, in this order, in order to go to this location\", blocking off chunks of the world until the correct item is obtained or dungeon is beaten, and dungeons that take hours to beat. \n\nTo me, Breath of the Wild is a massive breath of fresh air. I've poured over 300 hours between three save games (I'm currently on my third), and not even Skyrim (the last open world game I played before this one) did that for me. I loved exploring its world, I had a lot of fun with the new combat system, the breaking weapons actually made me really try out and appreciate the weapon variety and made finding new weapon types more special, and I loved the sheer amount of things you could do such as hijacking and riding a deer, setting things on fire, using magic (the runes) in creative ways and so much more.\n\nI do feel it has its flaws. Like balance - once you play long enough, you can become overpowered. As Supra said, the shrines and divine beasts are not separately themed. The lack of enemy variety never bothered me, but it really could use more enemy types, now that I think about it. And the density of the world itself varies - sometimes it's super dense and you find a lot of interesting things going on in a short period of time, while other times you can travel for a long time and it takes a while to find something of interest. The world should have been more dense, imo, but I dealt with it.\n\nThat said, this game brought back the feeling of exploration and danger and mystery that the very first game had in my childhood, but with many more added things on top of it, like the sheer beauty of many of the awesome looking locations - something the NES could have never pulled off. The game is a bit slow (especially compared to the fast pace of Super Mario Odyssey), but I think it accomplishes a lot, and I love the experience.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Daytime Sky", "channel": "UC92NMqb5TiODX4x5uHFW3nA", "votes": "24", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJw1Fj6WqstDDL8UIk1JNkQDfZV7p8CHRj9hzyYA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

Nintendo calling this an \"open-air\" experience makes so much sense once you play it. Link went from being stuck to the ground to having more freedom in his movements than 99% of the characters you play as in other games, including open-world games. Being able to climb pretty much everything had to be a core element right from the start of development, but to me it's the early access to the paraglider that made this experience so enjoyable. There's nothing quite like the feeling you get when you jump from a high mountain and glide along while looking down at the amazing world Nintendo has created. And most of time, anywhere you look, you will find something that will make you want to go there. The world itself and the freedom of movement is by far my highlights of this game. I don't want to focus too much on the negatives, but I do think BOTW is far from perfect. The lack of dungeons and all the shrines feeling the same because of their aesthetics are probably my biggest disapointments. Funnily enough, even if it has been criticized, I did like the combat system with the weapons breaking. Rarely has a game made me play around with various weapons like this one, simply because they kept breaking. Normally, I would find a weapon type I really like and stick with it. Managing your weapons (and items in general) definitely could have been done better. Is this my favorite Zelda ever? No, it's not. And part of me believes that the next game in the series will take the best of BOTW and fix a lot of problems it had (and dungeons please? each with their theme?). If that happens, that game might take the crown as my favorite Zelda of all time.

Personally i really disliked the fact that most of the items you collect in the overworld get boring and stale too over time.  \nAll there is is gems, vegetables and critters along with the occasional korok seeds\nAlso too many boring repetitive and similar enemies everywhere, not enough variety.\n\nLet's be honest it's quite a boring overworld.. a bit too big to be great.  \n\nAlso it needs much more music variety. The overal music kinda sucked/ or lack of tbh.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "heyjeySigma", "channel": "UCCCtgYlKr9lbmPYHIKcpfQw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz99inFIK7BuehtM2N89u-uKvY-oUedraBGv-ZE=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

Most of the game was amazing, but the lack of themed dungeons was really a shame. Also, as cool as all the powers were, and having them early, I missed the revelatory moments of getting a new item in a dungeon and having everything in the dungeon put in a new context. It was wonderful in past games to discover what new possibilities opened up once you found the dungeon item. It was cool to be able to do anything in BotW if you had the knowhow, but I don't think there's anything wrong with making it Metroidvania-esque and returning to areas once you have new items.\n\nI also wished there was more enemy variety, but that was a smaller complaint.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "CitrusFury", "channel": "UCm5xNXLGHIu8MxBJcZkFFLg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxmWWjiySD43Xviu7MkaQ4sTTuFY0lauAD9mXwi=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

You gain weapons all over the place, and they break in turn quite fast. I never had a fear of running out of weapons, and I didn't save the best ones either. I think that is the mistake many people do. They save super strong weapons and they don't wanna see them break.\n\nAs for dungeon themes, every dungeon (not counting shrines) has their own theme. I honestly think these are some of the better dungeon themes I've heard in a long time. They really help create a really cool atmosphere.\n\nAlso, great choice!
