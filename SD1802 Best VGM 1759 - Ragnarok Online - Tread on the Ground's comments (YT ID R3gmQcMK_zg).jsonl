I wouldn't suggest you play of fRO (french \"official\") or iRO (International / USA \"Official) because they are private servers in denial, but they are still fun none the less, I play on TalonRO and HibbsRO (How I beat baphomet).\n\nSimple sentence? Ismetric 3D world with 2D sprites, old, classic and fun.\nThe pvp seems to be balanced on a lot of servers, and some servers are \"open world pvp\" but most are arena and War of Emperium (Guild vs guild) pvp.\nI hate grinding in all game, RO's is extensive but isnt completely bad if you have someone to assist you, to have fun while grinding! You can do dungeons as much as you want, they are open for all after all (exept a select few that need an entrance quest, Isntances on the other hand have 24h cooldown.\nIf you want some help, we can talk in the meantime!", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "ZeroPT", "channel": "UCFQ3BP-yMaxoFsa9q92lUaw", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwl_R1BjmwTYq31fp26blzeqyE99XEiKBrf9J-NPg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
