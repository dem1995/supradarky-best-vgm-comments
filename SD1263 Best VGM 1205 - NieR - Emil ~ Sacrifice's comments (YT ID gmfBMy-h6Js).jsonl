This is the definition of a flawed gem. It's got problems but it's still amazing as a whole. I should go back to it and get the last ending... but I want to get all the trophies first and the grinding is just so boring. :\\", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "GabeMorris", "channel": "UCjU40JrE_1myo0B6flbKpiQ", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyZs0LgbZ30lgmQnxGqSEJHzPmp5rwHtgU5TQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

Awesome game, I wasn't disappointed even if it has a list of flaws when it comes to the gameplay and some weird design choices. Having to replay part of the game a couple times to see all the endings did feel like a chore, but it paid off. Very memorable and emotional story, you rarely get that from a video game. The soundtrack was of course top notch with amazing vocals by Emi Evans.", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
