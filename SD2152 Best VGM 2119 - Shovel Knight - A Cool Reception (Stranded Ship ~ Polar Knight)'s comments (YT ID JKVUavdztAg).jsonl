I am not good at platformers and I do not play them much at all, but Shovel Knight I made the exception too. If I could, I would have purchased this game for $60, but it was $40 on Switch for the Treasure Trove edition. I canâ€™t believe how long I waited to play this absolute gem (pun intended). I really hope they continue into this universe in the future, but from what I heard, King Knight will be their last adventure in it. Itâ€™s still great, but I fell in love with everybody in here.
