I feel like it used the best parts of loved classics like Mega Man, Duck Tales, Castlevania, etc. to make an almost perfect platformer that also feels fresh thanks to more modern mechanics. The base challenge isn't too high, but leaving the choice to the player to make it harder by breaking checkpoints or avoiding to use powerful items is exactly what I like. It helps that it also has my favorite soundtrack of the year, props to Jake and Matsumae. I find this theme quite underrated, it fits perfectly with the haunted halls.
