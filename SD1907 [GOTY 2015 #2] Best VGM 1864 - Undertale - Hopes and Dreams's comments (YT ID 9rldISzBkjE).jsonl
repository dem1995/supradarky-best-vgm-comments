{"cid": "UggaTEtPeeUWZ3gCoAEC", "text": "This is one of those songs that I've listened to so much- and one of those games that's been discussed so much- that I've become jaded. For some reason, however, listening to this song, right now, with the particular image you chose to accompany it for the video, really brought memories of this game back. ASGORE is my favorite song in the game, but this is probably my favorite moment, and seeing this song here enabled me to relive that. \nI feel like UNDERTALE's explosive popularity has colored the game for me. There's something about seeing it everywhere like Minecraft or Minions that demeans the game in my memory. I feel as though it is an experience that I am no longer privy to, and I have to share it with legions of internet popular culture drones. It's difficult to maintain the integrity of your own thoughts when you're surrounded with thousands of strident voices. Perhaps there is nothing wrong with people talking about things they liked, but I myself felt that I appreciated the game more retrospectively when it wasn't yet popular culture.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Côte de Bœuf", "channel": "UC8B0WeMBVBpVh1vBE0gXiZw", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzfeTfcYvw195W0RqN8SdkdIizCDZ-5UVZ4rETsTg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

{"cid": "UghfR1Gg3z3YFngCoAEC", "text": "For quite some time, this was my favorite game of the year. Even now, it's extremely close behind my #1. I can't help but be amazed by Toby Fox for creating this game: hybrid RPG/bullet hell battle system, the option to be passive or agressive against your opponents, a story reflecting your choices in a truly different way. But to me, the biggest highlights are the cast of characters (Sans and Papyrus are my favorites) and the soundtrack which is easily my favorite of the year. If I had to identify some flaws for me, it would be that the middle section doesn't keep up with the superb beginning (including the whole section with Sans and Papyrus) and ending sections of the game. I also think the battle system, when playing passively, could have been fleshed out in a way that needs more strategy. For example, there could be more cues to what you should say to your oponent and more penalties when you say something that has no effect, as I'd often find myself simply testing everything until I find the right sequence. I also don't see myself ever replaying it now that I've gone through the 3 endings. Still, this is a great gaming experience that I'll probably never forget, and I feel like the ending(s) really helped elevate it to the already \"classic\" status it has.

The big 3: Witcher 3, MGS5 and Bloodborne. I still need to finish Witcher 2 and I'll be honest, I have a hard time getting drawn into this series' world and find the battle/skills system average (should I blame the Souls series?). As for MGS5, I only played a couple hours and while I find the gameplay/controls to be the best in the series, it's been a huge disappointment so far. I feel like I will like the game itself, but not as a MGS entry. Then we have Bloodborne which, honestly, might have had a big chance of being my #1 of the year, but I still want to go through Dark Souls 2 first and I don't have a PS4 yet. Another mention would be Xenoblade Chronicles X, but I'm currently playing through the first game which I'm absolutely loving so far.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "6", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

I highly doubt that it will become such a classic and that many will care about it in 10 years.

If you have trouble caring about Witcher 2, I just advice to skip it and go straight to 3, it's a much better game.), how anybody can even put it as their GOTY is beyond me.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Viehzerrer", "channel": "UCCKJCggr05gqkb2qxv-c2nA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwHqLoauSGOZfodr4ig0yKh8Flq6u7pQ_wTvQjD=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
