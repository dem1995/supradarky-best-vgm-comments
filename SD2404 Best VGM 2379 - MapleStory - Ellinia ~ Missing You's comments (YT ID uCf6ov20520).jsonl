I stopped playing after the release of the Resistance classes, before the Mechanic class was released.

I started on the Windia server and in 2007 when the Mardia server was created I joined up there, which was where I stayed until I stopped playing. \nI made it up to level 132 as a Shadower, which was severely overshadowed by the Dual Blader class released in 2010 (a major part of why I quit the game). It felt awful to have dedicated years to a character just to have that character be all but made useless.\nI absolutely loved my time with Maplestory.
