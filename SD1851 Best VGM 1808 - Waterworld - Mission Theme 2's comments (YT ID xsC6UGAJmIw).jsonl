And not only applies it to SNES, but many early generations of games and arts, to the degree where it still has a cult following today.\n\nThe most intriguing thing about graphics and music of twenty to thirty years ago was how limited they were on tools and resources. Where today, all you would have to do to make a simple poster is open a (free and precompiled) editor you downloaded off the net and some stencils, back then you would most likely have to write the software yourself and do all the drawing by hand. Good teams were essential. I recall illustrated tutorials and interviews in 90s game magazines several pages long portraying some thirteen steps to digitise a simple drawing from paper. You couldn't afford a scanner, so you had to trace the drawings on the actual paper. Graph paper came in handy here. Apart from memory capacity at the time, high resolutions were too labour intensive, so sprite graphics quickly caught on. People became really creative with their work, too, to best take advantage of the limitations. The end result, of course, wasn't always pretty. It was pretty ugly to be honest, and I think everyone agreed upon that, but were too aroused by the amazing technology to really notice. Music also played a vital role.\n\nMuch as one generation of games sucked, the next was considerably better. I think it helped that so many teams tried and failed. Many, many awful genres of games that never should have seen the light of day. Fantasy was recurring; mysterious and otherworldly themes which weren't easily portrayed and better left to the imagination. Puzzles were popular too. So was born the games we know and love today. I think the presentation of old-school games is timeless. Because it is so vastly different from modern games, they aren't quite comparable, and, yes, share similarities with for example a book.", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "Marie Loiseau", "channel": "UCEdTk3EHLn6pq6I8ckvBlvg", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyPlugDDx9Am94zqf10Bniomh6d-R12NLo99DfUww=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
