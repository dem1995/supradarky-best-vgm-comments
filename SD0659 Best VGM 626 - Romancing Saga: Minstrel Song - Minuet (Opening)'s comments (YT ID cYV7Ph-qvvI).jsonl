SaGa games are super fun. Sure they are a bit hard, and Unlimited SaGa;s gameplay is VERY dire, but the other games are buttery sweet! If you guys hate the difficulty, try the Final Fantasy Legend games.(Yes, they ARE SaGa games, they had to use the Final Fantasy Name to lure buyers) They are much easier yet no less rewarding. Also keep in mind that FFL is kinda edited censored so you might want to go with the Wonderswan version instead.  Amazing games.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Jose Osorio", "channel": "UCnrfgyeqd8Yurubp6JtHbxw", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxLvEr2dNLnt6KKK8KNMa6sBP7FIGkYG7aryg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
