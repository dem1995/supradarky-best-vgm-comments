It's supposed to be a dark game. Now I'm not emo or whatever,but I do love the storyline of Shadow Hearts one and two. The bgm made you actually feel like you're in a horror movie/crime scene drama. Then it came together all marvelously linking both the first and second game. The good ending of part 2 explains how Alice is alive at the end of the first one good ending. Yuri manages to kill Atman and beat the living or dead shit out of those masks. Now given Yuri's personality,he is more arrogant and laid back in the first game. Even more that pacing to the good ending was loose and left loopholes. Seeing how Yuri's personality flipped when discovering that Alice was about to be killed. He beat down the masks and broke through that door. So in short,part 1 and part 2 was great,it ended in a tragedy in both games really,but towards the end of part 2,Yuri was given another chance to make things right.
