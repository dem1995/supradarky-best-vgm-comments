{"cid": "UgxsI_heQsWljEQ_23t4AaABAg", "text": "I've always been a bigger fan of the 8-bit Mega Man games (well, including 9 & 10) for their graphics and music, so I have to admit I was disappointed when MM11 turned out to be 2.5D. As much as some games do it well, I feel like a lot of 2.5D games are lifeless and feel cheap looking, and it's also why something like the upcoming Bloodstained is nowhere near as attractive to me as fully 2D Metroidvanias. Still, I did hear good things about MM11.
