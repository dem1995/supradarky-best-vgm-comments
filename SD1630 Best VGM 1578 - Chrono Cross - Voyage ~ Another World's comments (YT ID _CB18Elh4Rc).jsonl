I can't think of a single tune that didn't fit its location perfectly. The music really embodied the \"sailing around tropical islands\" theme of the game, which is why it's supposed to be lighthearted at times, but it can still tug at your heartstrings in the right places, like in the good ending.\n\nThe music in this game had such a unique feel and unique instruments, something no other game has really had.  This was the first game that really got me to notice video game music. FF7 had great music too, don't get me wrong, but there are so many more memorable songs in Chrono Cross! It's hard to think of a single tune in this game that wasn't spectacular. The music is just so vibrant and well composed.\n\nAnd that's just some of the reasons why Chrono Cross has the greatest soundtrack of all time.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "drunyon214", "channel": "UCfgBY0FOQeuY96Ugxi4iQKQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJztYMme2iPg2W6LuOXT_xoQLNVp0F3u84UTfzJw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

I went back and played it on PS1 in a collection with FFVI I purchased one year. I agree that it's one of the worst battle themes. Not because the instrumentation, I just it's all over the place, and It's a song that you do have to hear a LOT. I do not think it would've been as jarring had it been a once in a while fight theme/specific boss battle, or something like that. Aside form that battle theme, I think CC has one of the best soundtracks of all time. I come back to it time and time again. The other tracks are just that good.
