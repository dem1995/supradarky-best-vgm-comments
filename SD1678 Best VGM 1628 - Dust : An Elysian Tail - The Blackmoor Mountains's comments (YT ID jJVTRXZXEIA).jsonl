The presentation (graphics, animation, music) is top notch and the story is surprisingly good.

The battle system feels like it never truly evolves and stays very basic, with your companion Fidget's magic being overpowered. I button mashed my way through the whole game. I also found most of the disconnected level design too linear and simple, making my trek through the game not very memorable.
