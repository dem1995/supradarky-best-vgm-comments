Often enough I see western artists trying to incorporate the anime style in their art and failing somehow at it.

I don't think this is somehow a problem in the left, as I was saying this was a problem in western artists in general as you've read. What I did tried to say though was that the leftists particularly have a lot of misconceptions about art specifically, for example their demand for \"diversity\" in comics/games, their demand for \"realistic boobs\" in anime stuff and so on. Like, they try to prioritize their political view above creative freedom and that can show (potentially) a lack of understanding in how art truly works. They prefer to change a character's skin color or sexuality than to add more character to them. Recently they changed Isaac's design from Castlevania: Curse of Darkness in the new season planned for the Netflix Castlevania series:\n\nOriginal: https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/castlevania/images/9/99/Isaac.png/revision/latest?cb=20170929204539&path-prefix=pt-br\n\nNetflix's ver: https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/d/da/Isaac_animation_2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20181009223250\n\n As you can compare, the rich aesthetic value the original design had is totally lost, apparently just to ensure the leftist demand for diversity is reached. They prefere statements over art quality (as you can see the redesign is just plain bad or simpler than the original) in a lot of situations, that can show a real tendency.

This poor grasp of art also might have to do with people making well-intentioned but misguided attempts to appease people who either get offended at something no matter what, or pretend to be offended to shut down art they don't like.
