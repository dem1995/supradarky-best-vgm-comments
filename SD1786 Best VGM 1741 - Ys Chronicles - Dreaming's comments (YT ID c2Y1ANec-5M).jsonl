{"cid": "Ugh6tRkbZuavpngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-j_dY7-IuuAALZnc", "text": "@真MugiwaraCrono Ys I/II has been released on a lot of systems since its first release in 1989 (Japan), including PC.\n\nIf you want to start from the beginning, I'd rather suggest picking up the Steam version of Ys I&II. You can switch to the old graphics and three versions of the music any time you want, so you can check the differences between all of them. Ys I is actually rather short for a JRPG (8~10 hours tops), and Ys II is slightly longer but not too much (~12-14 hours, perhaps?).\n\nYs Origins is quite nice, and it is a modern prequel to the events in Ys I/II.\n\nHowever, IMHO, I think Felghana (the remake of Ys III) is the best game out of all those currently available on Steam. I think you'll find it easier to play Felghana first and get addicted to Ys, play I/II for the \"bump\" system and then play Origins for the backstory.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Antonio García Domínguez", "channel": "UC8_3bzV6RBMjJ27y0hYczlA", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzSJdkgD_PK7tPq0spMjXruMde6Vl1IQchs4lQwGhM=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

It is an amazing game in my opinion because of the fast-paced action! And the music is a constant reminder of how intense this game is. This specific track is in one of the later levels of the game only though. But there are MANY great moments before it! Also quick tip, when you get to the vampire boss, just keep it going! He is one of the more annoying bosses in the game, but I personally beat him after maybe an hour because of how he works.
