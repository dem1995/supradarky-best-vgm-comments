{"cid": "Ugx6vLHRvHAFbtBdMQp4AaABAg", "text": "The perfect summer tropical theme to relax with a nice drink, I especially like the flute break at 0:57. Captain Rainbow seems to be a great game but was a commercial failure. I feel bad for Skip Ltd really, they never found success with their games: the Chibi-Robo series was only mildly successful with its first game, and both Giftpia and CR never left Japan. They are all very unique games and that may unfortunately be the reason for their failure, people can be turned off by games that look too weird. The great news is that this game has a fan translation so I'll definitely give it a shot one day.", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "20", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
