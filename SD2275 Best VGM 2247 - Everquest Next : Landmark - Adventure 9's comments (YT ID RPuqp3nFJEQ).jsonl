Everquest Next was famously cancelled and they somehow decided it was a good idea to release the game's player content creation tool under Landmark, which completely failed and shut down after only 6 months. The biggest letdown for me was that Jeremy Soule's music went down with it before anyone really discovered how great it was. A truly underrated soundtrack by a well known and amazing musician.
