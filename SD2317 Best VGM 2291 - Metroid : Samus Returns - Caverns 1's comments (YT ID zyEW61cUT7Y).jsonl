{"cid": "UgyhehtYPH2ohl0AfgZ4AaABAg", "text": "When you listen to Caverns 1 from the original game, you can only appreciate the work Matsuoka put in this remix: I love the one-two sound starting at 1:00, as well as the hi-hats at 1:40; mixed with the chorus and the strings, it makes for a very deep and menacing ambience perfectly fitting Metroid. I finished Samus Returns this week-end and while it was a solid remake, I just can't put my finger as to why the 10 hours felt so long. It might have to do with the fact that I played AM2R before, which to be honest I find many levels above this game. I don't think I'll ever be a fan of 2.5D games, but I do have to say the 3D effect was very well done when turned on. It just had this generally bland feeling to it. Apart from a boss battle or two, I never really got excited even when I got new upgrades. It's a good game, it just never reached the addictive and wow effect for me.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "27", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
