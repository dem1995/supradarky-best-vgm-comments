{"cid": "UgxeGne3nY9ogffJBPd4AaABAg", "text": "Usually games/movies with time travel focus on the future being more interesting and how events today influence that future outcome. This game reverses that and makes it so the past is the most interesting and mysterious part of the world, and the things that happen in that time period shape the present reality. This game and especially the music from 12,000 BC era captures the mystique perfectly. It feels like the height of advancement, and in many ways it is--the Gurus shape the world by employing their understanding in concrete ways, but are influenced and forced to work under a selfish and vain leader, oddly freed from her by Lavos own action to split them up in time. Even though all 3 are separated, they still use their knowledge and abilities to do things that together, unbeknownst to them all, work together to save the world, without them being certain of the outcome. Courage and hope displayed in spite of the overwhelming calamity they witnessed at the hands of Lavos. While I don't know if this is a reference to the trinity of God, I do find it interesting that all 3 of them seem to be of one mind and action in many ways, made manifest in different forms, and that their assistance to the heroes is selfless. Also interesting is that the seemingly victorious action of the enemy itself leads paradoxically to it's defeat. (Lavos freeing the gurus from the influence and command of Queen Zeal by throwing them into different parts of time)", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Kassadinftw", "channel": "UCrKQVUGL8BW6Cu7MAIe-6xA", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzU5lCm3wydQWdf_Gz3ZZMwPU6EQl947PCCVQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

{"cid": "Uggo1idvaX4uaHgCoAEC", "text": "Woho, I just finished Chrono Trigger for the first time! Here is my personal opinions of the game. \n\nI have always loved the snes era so I thought I had missed out on something when I had not played Chrono Trigger. It turns out I got mixed feelings about the game though.\n\nFirst of all did I not like the gameplay. I prefer regular turn based over this, like in earthbound or golden sun (man I love those two games). I am quite surprised over me not liking the gameplay since I usually like it when you mix things up in jrpgs (like in xenoblade or in earthbound where your life scrolls down instead of drops instantly after an attack), however in chrono trigger the gameplay was just stressful, which is the opposite of what I want from a jrpg!\n\nAnd for the second, I did not like the fantasy setting the game was in. It just felt alot like dungeons and dragons or something similar. I am not a fan of fantasy overall, and I do not like dragon ball either so that does not make the setting any better. :(\n\nThese two complaints are probably the only reason why I have so many mixed feelings for the game. Unfortunately I did not like two very important aspects of the game. :( \n\nThat being said, this is not a bad game! It is just not my game.. unfortunately.\n\nHowever, I must say I found myself amazed over 12000 bc. That was so awesome! The snowstorm under the clouds, and then you ascend over the clouds and this music starts playing and you see that you are in a highly advanced city shivers. I think 12000 bc was the best part of the game, and probably the part of the game I found most memorable!

Games nowadays are padded with meaningless content to make you feel like it was \"worth it\" to pay for it. As in, people started to complain that they paid 50 USD for a game that lasted 20 - 40 hours. As games developed and became increasingly expensive (motion capture, cgi, soundtracks), they had to compensate for the price, advertising \"hundreds\" of hours of gameplay and content.\n\nI'm not saying this happens with all games, of course. But in most of them, you have a single player campaign that lasts 20 hours and 250 hours of meaningless, padding or lame sidequests that gives you a shallow experience.\n\nThere is also the factor that videogames stopped being developed by gamers for gamers, (and also as a medium of art), and started being developed by businessmen to make money.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Gabriel Simoes", "channel": "UCrogjmbJZkWQfZQhNuDF8DQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzH9T3aT9G0-NKrMQISockcfjkM5nHgziX2_b4Yig=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

{"cid": "UgjjW1CWv3mFNHgCoAEC", "text": "If you add &hd=1 to the end of the url you get better sound, but video quality is the same. Pretty sure this works for a lot of videos listed as 240/360p, because years ago many videos that were 480p, and maybe 360p, became/were lowered to 240/360p. There may have also been videos that were originally 240p, but still had their audio quality lowered.\n\nThey seem to still be on YouTube's servers in their original quality, just not normally accessible without that extra bit of text at the end of the url. I found this out by trying it out one day a year or two ago, after realizing their were larger sizes available when I downloaded videos using KeepVid.\n\nFor example with this video what you normally see on Youtube is the one listed on KeepVid as 240p, and is 4.19MB in size. The one listed under \"(Max 480p)\" is 4.5MB in size. The video still appears to be of the same quality and 240p, but that extra 0.31MB seems to make a significant difference to the audio quality, allowing more depth of the music to come through. It's about a 6.9% difference in file size, and audio is usually significantly smaller than video, so this may be a large improvement one could expect in the sound on many videos.\n\nMy guess is that Youtube lowered the quality of many old videos years ago to save on bandwidth costs of people watching older videos that no longer provided them much profit, or something along those lines.\n\nI realize &hd=1 is normally known for playing back videos at 720p, but it seems to work for setting videos to the highest quality they can be played at (other than 1080p or above) even if 720p is not available.\n\nOn this video I find listening to it without the &hd=1 added makes many of the sounds kind of dull/muffled/flat sounding.
