One of the first Playstation games in Japan, we got it much later with the release of Arc the Lad Collection (which includes the first 3 games).

I'm surely glad to have this collection in my library, I'll play it again someday.", "time": "9 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

I one hundred percent agree that 2 was the high point of the franchise, but I wasn't disappointed by 3. It's different, sure, and I can see that turning a lot of people off to it. But I really appreciated the improvements in terms of gameplay mechanics and the much more robust Hunter job system so that you can have jobs that are not solely \"Go to place, fight monster\" as it was in the second game. And after the very heavy subject matter of the first two games, I personally don't mind its initially lighter tone. Not only is it a bit of a pallet cleanser after the heartbreaking ending of ATL 2, it also provides a nice contrast; whereas the first two games have a very dark tone over a modern-ish world, 3 has the world in the wake of near armageddon yet shows off humanity's survivalist spirit and desire to overcome the calamity that befell it despite the greatly reduced standard level of technology. Again, I can see why people don't like it coming off the second game, since it's definitely trying to be different in a variety of ways but personally I enjoy it a lot.", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "Shenaldrac", "channel": "UC6EzmJfmDJnxEghdodoV6SA", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzX0UQ0_1TriPb32D88z-HXbk65JMkO6pZWEA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
