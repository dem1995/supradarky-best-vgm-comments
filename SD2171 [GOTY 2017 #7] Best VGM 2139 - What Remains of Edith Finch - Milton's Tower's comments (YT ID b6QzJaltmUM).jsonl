{"cid": "Ugwy_LPccK3JMnMWQA14AaABAg", "text": "I'm far from the biggest fan of Walking Simulators, but from time to time comes great ones like Edith Finch. This is quite easily my favorite one so far. The atmosphere surrounding the Finch family's now abandoned house is top notch, and the length of the game is perfect. However, it's really how the story is intertwined with the gameplay that makes it stand out. Learning about each family member's story through a unique gameplay element was such a great idea to prevent the game from feeling stale, which is often what happens in this genre (at least for me). Some of these little stories were highly memorable (the bath, the fishery...), and to me much more interesting than the overarching story itself. A perfect game for one sitting.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "15", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
