It's a pretty fun, entertaining 3D platformer in the vein of Super Mario 64, and it's got a pretty good soundtrack--especially the final boss. It's...surprisingly bad*ss for a SpongeBob game; you might want to check it out.\n\nAlso, nice choice for this time, I liked this track!", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Nate Jacobson", "channel": "UCaFZ0tj9KakxHWp-8rRTiAg", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzC0LORMw6EmszZPoMc5pjzSEEq0Zble9eJSA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

{"cid": "UghdOj_GqRWccngCoAEC", "text": "I really enjoyed the game and the music of the game. This song's one of my favorites. Maybe I haven't played enough Metroidvanias but it didn't feel forced to me and I didn't mind the time it took to get teleporters. What I loved especially for secret hunters is the hole with spikes on the bottom has a secret room if you hug the right wall. You get a chest with goodies but they do nothing since you can't get back up.

{"cid": "UggD28PDo0rhmngCoAEC", "text": "I've been playing this game and it's a pretty fun retro platformer. It's basically a linear Metroidvania which honestly, is simply not as good as an interconnected one. I feel like it took way too much time to get the double jump and the teleporters to prevent backtracking on foot. The game constantly throws references to other classics in all aspects (enemy design, music, gameplay, cameos) and while it sometimes feel forced and unoriginal, another part of me does enjoy and smile at it. The soundtrack is the definite highlight for me.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "10", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
