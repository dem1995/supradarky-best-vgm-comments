Many talented artists in the past created Silent Hill and MGS. But now, seeing Silent Hills series ruined by the company, and Kojima unfairly treated (denied his awards... when he is the one who deserve the rights to such titles and accomplishments) and kicked out of the company shows that Konami is no longer the company for gamers. Well, recent behaviors of Konami (especially with CEO change) have shown that days like this would come. Konami now focuses on making money out of their franchise rather than respecting the games, gamers, and the artists. Unfortunately, Konami from years ago is no longer the same Konami as is today - that treats their artists unfairly and ignores the right voice of the gamers.

{"cid": "Ugh6z88EIv9wZ3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-IYHt7C5C9-RbERg", "text": "To put it out there, if your mind has never been blown by the dissertation worthy explanation of why Silent Hill is not about gods, demons, or ghosts, but instead psychics, go read SilentPyramid's plot summary FAQ http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps/198641-silent-hill/faqs/36931\n\nThe original did a lot of really cool stuff the later ones never topped, such as the otherworld transitions for the hospital and school... For all the wonders of advancing tech, the limitations at the time forced them to get creative... Not that the walls and floors peeling away into flyash to reveal bloody rusted metal isn't cool, but it will NEVER top the moment I headed back to the elevator confused after the 3rd floor of the hospital was empty, and stopped to ask myself \"Was... was that 4th floor button there last time?\"\n\nThat said... objectively, 2 is the best title. Devil's advocate can be played, but there really is no validly disputing that... the whole series is just thick with metaphor, symbolism, hidden meaning, infered plot points, and other complexities, but none of the other titles are as nuanced as 2. The writing is just a step up. The graphics aren't as sharp, and the controls are so jank I've known even dedicated fans who couldn't suffer through it, but if we're judging on artistic merit (which is how they should be judged), it has to be 2.\n\nI will say though, on a personal note, I adored The Room. The idea of having a \"spiritual sequel\" where we saw a total departure from the central focal point of Alessa and replaced it with Walter, a machinator of similar power and origin but with entirely different motives and rules to his world was bold and (for me at least) paid off on every level. With 3 having established in full the mechanics of the powerset, it was interesting to take the old concept of experiencing the nightmare of another person we were used to and turn it on it's head by having the nightmare originate from a totally different person than the first 3. The concept of \"The Room\", and relying on things like the peephole, the tunnel, the phone, the window, and the door's looking glass to effectively force you to operate in isolation was an inspired brushstroke to address the protagonists repressed voyeuristic impulses. The idea of being safe in \"The Room\", but your only escape is to crawl into a nightmare and be at risk was a highly engaging emotional conflict... Fatal Frame 3 did it a little better with the idea of your sleeping slowly killing you, but being defenseless while awake; but this was an excellent conceptual game element in it's own right. When the fan breaks, your only safehaven is jeopardized, and you're left forced with the ugly choice of expending your frightfully scarce items for defense to keep safe in the otherworld, or purge your base of corruption... with consequences depending. The investigator made for a combination of an excellent foil to deliver information to us fans while being one of the most memorable moments in the series for me. Taking all this, and a rather vast improvement in gameplay, and I like it almost as much as two... but it's more one man's opinion.\n\n3, I have to say, I did not like. The expansion/clarification of the setting mechanics was good to have, and I won't say it didn't have it's moments (I thought our moments with Vincent were particularly well done by the standards of any of the games), but the ramp up in difficulty/pressure not to use guns despite melee becoming worthless bothered me deeply. I truly loath the introductions of running or \"hiding\" by flicking off the light on a mandatory basis. The idea of being bad at combat to drive home the feeling of helplessness is noble, but die and reload enough times, it DETRACTS from fear factor, and the constant stress (which is not the same as fear) was not enjoyable. Exacerabting this was the fact that WAY too much of the game was running through \"dungeons\" for basically no reason. From the mall to the sewer to that building UGH. It just went on FOREVER, with nearly no plot advancement in the process. And while expanding on the Alessa narrative is interesting enough, it wasn't as original or inspired as 2, 4, or even Origins... It just brought very little in the way of new artistry, 1 having hit all the high notes of the topic, as it were.\n\nOrigin's was infuriating, with the stupid breaking weapons, the \"struggle to escape\" mechanic, the jank psp controls, Travis running out of breath, respawning enemies, and the fact that the boss you just struggled to kill will cover the map when you leave... That said, I enjoyed the expansion of the story with Lisa and the other SH1 cast members, and Travis's personal narrative brought a lot to the table... The idea of mirrors was both symbolically inspired as well as a great mechanics feature an a brutal poke at Travis's subconscious fear that he inherited the same traits that drove his parents to maddness and suicide. Shattered Memories was a bold idea, with it's profiling and such, but the parkor mechanic basis for the gameplay rendered it outright unplayable for me... I had to watch a friend beat it for me... and that REALLY soured me to it. The first movie I stand by my statement was fantastic, the 2nd had a lot of problems and was a huge drop in quality. Downpour I have yet to play, Homecoming... eh... let's not mince words... it was bad. And if no one's read them, there's a whole slew of comics too... Dying Inside in particular, I really liked. Hills though, Hills... Kojima, DelToro, Reedus, insane graphics, and hopefully and almost Adventure genre style gameplay if the PT proof of concept is any indication?
