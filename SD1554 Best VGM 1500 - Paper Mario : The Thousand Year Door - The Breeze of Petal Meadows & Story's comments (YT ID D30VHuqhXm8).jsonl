Also the only reason I like Bowser's Inside Story the most in the Mario and Luigi games is because it's fricken Bowser! Bowser is the greatest. Getting to see a different side of him than you see in other games is what makes that game so much fun. Don't you remember Super Mario RPG and how cool it was to have Bowser on your side. That's what Bowser's Inside Story felt like to me and plus I think that game has the best music in the Mario and Luigi series. Yoko Shimomura is a god. Don't forget what other game she composed on (Super Mario RPG). Can't help it but shutter when I think of the Forest Maze song. The Mario RPG series is hands down the greatest series in existence. It is the perfect combination of quirkiness and amazingly fun gameplay elements that puts it on the top of my list. Thanks for making this video.

Â What you've heard is right, battling only rewards you with some coins back and practice, which is important, but not nearly as important as having stronger stickers and you'll probably battle enough just avoiding enemies. Â In RPGs I battle every enemy I see until it stops giving EXP, but in this game, although they give out stickers like it's water, I was really sad that battles were just an annoyance by anyone's terms. Â I would not recommend getting this game no matter who you are, it's just that bad WITH the name tag Paper Mario. If you ignore it's a Paper Mario game, it's OK, but still pretty bad.\n\nEither way, the characters very high consciousness of their paper material, the lack of a rewarding battle system, huge leaps in difficulty at some points, and character's unbridled tongue when it comes to talking paper kill the game for me.\n\nHowever...\n\nMario & Luigi: Dream Team is an amazing game. Â I wouldn't say as fun as the first two games, but definitely better than M&L: Bowser's Inside Story. Â It's a bit easier because they decided to add a hard mode like in LoZ:OoT 3D, but I wish they would have given me that option from the very beginning. Â I wish I could tell you more, but I haven't played it in a while due to my L and R buttons breaking.

I've never been too big on RPGs and the flip mechanic looked like lots of fun. After countless recommendations, I went back to the rest of the series and loved them a lot. Thanks to the Paper Mario games, I'm always willing to give any RPG a chance, but sadly I still haven't gotten to play super mario rpg.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "darkseid1321", "channel": "UC8nHhege8vY1otQyy7synhg", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJw0dmaDOQqUgR8KEILDU0IPIVRefz4JYQKdXNUL=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
{"cid": "UggteadCFs4TF3gCoAEC", "text": "Congrats on this one!Â  Super Mario RPG games are my favourite RPG franchise.Â  I prefer Paper Mario to Mario and Luigi.Â  I can say that Super Mario RPG is my favourite for nostalgic reasons being the first RPG I've played, but from a gameplay perspective, Thousand Year Door takes the cake. I'd love a sequel to the original Mario RPG.Â  The only FF cameo I can think of is a Moogle or a Black Mage.Â  In terms of a genre to bring RPG elements to, I can't really think of one.Â  Maybe something like Actraiser on SNES, but better?Â ", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "SMRPGFAN101", "channel": "UC50BxktKxmzoV4Ugb1jwsjg", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyFsQPR7uqt9LipKj-Ioy03lG10twWRoCw9Mw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
