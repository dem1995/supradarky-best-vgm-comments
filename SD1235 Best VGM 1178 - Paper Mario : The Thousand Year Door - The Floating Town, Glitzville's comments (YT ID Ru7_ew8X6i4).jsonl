So without further wait: Best VGM 1177 - Final Fantasy XIV - Goobbue Mount, more specific: search Coeurl, Ahriman and Co. Mount (since it isn't special apparently). If you ever need to find another song that's lost, go to twitter and search for the one that is missing, you should be able to find something that leads you to it, goodbye everyone and please don't take this comment down because it's for history porpuses.
