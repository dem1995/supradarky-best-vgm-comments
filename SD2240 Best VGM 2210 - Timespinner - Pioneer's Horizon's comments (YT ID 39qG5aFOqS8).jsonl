{"cid": "Ugwdwi0q5YTw4dBcNrx4AaABAg", "text": "2018 truly is the year of the Metroidvanias, so many came out and most of them are extremely solid. I can't complain, it's one of my very favorite genres and I can't seem to get tired of it. I like seeing how the developers can give us unique ideas surrounding the genre's proven mold. Out of all the ones I played this year, Timespinner is the least unique but it doesn't end up hurting it: it's basically a light mix of Castlevania SOTN and Order of Ecclesia. They don't even try to hide it with the menu, the familiars, the passive relics, etc. It took me about 8 hours to 100% it and enjoyed it the whole way through. The different orbs that act as your weapons are nice to play around with and the variety is good enough that players probably each have their own personal favorites. The familiars are mostly useless however, as well as the Timestop mechanic which should have been a central part of the gameplay. Still, an overall very enjoyable and nostalgic Metroidvania, including one of my favorite soundtracks of the year. It's crazy how close Jeff Ball got to Yamane's style. This track may be my favorite and feels straight out of Order of Ecclesia.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "27", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
