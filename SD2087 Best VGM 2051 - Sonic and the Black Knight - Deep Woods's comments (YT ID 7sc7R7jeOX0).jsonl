That's at least what I thought while listening to this song, while imagining the whole Sega and Sonic thing they've had going on, modernly with their community. It's not evil because it is flawed. And by evil I mean, it doesn't deserve the evilness of people hating it for- simply their dislike of it. I think the most called out upon autistic stuff us humangs carry around is something that exists above the negativity that we all to often throw at it.
