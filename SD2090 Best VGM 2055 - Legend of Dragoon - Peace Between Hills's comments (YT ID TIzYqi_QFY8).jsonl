I was surprized to see how a semi-lengthy post could manage to contain such little detail.\n\nFor what it's worth when I first played this game I didn't like it much either.  I got up to the prison part in the beginning of the game and ditched it, I just wasn't interested for reasons I can't quite articulate.  However I picked up the game a year or two later and ended up loving it.  Played it again a few years later and still loved it.\n\nA few negative things I will say about the game:\n\nMost of the voice acting from what I recall is pretty bad.  Not having an open world map compared to most RPGs having one also made it feel a lot more restricting. Some of the tracks were bad, I don't recall liking the final boss's track much when normally the final boss of a game tends to have one of the best tracks.  Inventory was also an issue, but apparently only the NA version of this game had the issue; apparently the Japanese version allowed you to double your inventory slots at some point.\n\nThat was mainly it, I think.  Probably my favorite part about the game was the gameplay, it added an element of skill and creativity instead of just pressing the Attack command and watching my character do a bland slash.
