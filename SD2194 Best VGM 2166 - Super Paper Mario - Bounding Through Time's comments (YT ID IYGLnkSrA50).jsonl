{"cid": "UgwkczjKqRmyzfWEXXR4AaABAg.8fyF0cDH9388fyLtIVajJH", "text": "I hate thinking about where the Paper Mario series has wound up. Sticker Star had interesting ideas but wasn't much of an RPG, and was a general disappointment. Later, Paper Mario was relegated to a supporting character in Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam. Color Splash was apparently fairly good (though I haven't played it yet), although again it doubled down on the more action-adventure style, with very little in the way of RPG elements.\n\nApparently the excuse that's been given for recent Paper Mario games not being RPGs (by Nintendo employees no less) is \"we already have the Mario & Luigi series, we don't need another Mario RPG\", and I think it's a weak excuse. They were always very different sorts of RPGs.\n\nI loved Super Paper Mario, although it was the first step away from being an RPG series, but I really miss the days of the first two games. The Thousand Year Door was the best Paper Mario game IMO, and while I don't expect another game in that style, I'd sure love one. At the very least I hope they put out a remaster of it for the Switch.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "CitrusFury", "channel": "UCm5xNXLGHIu8MxBJcZkFFLg", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxmWWjiySD43Xviu7MkaQ4sTTuFY0lauAD9mXwi=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

Weirdly enough, Sticker Star and Colour Splash doesn't feel as experimental as earlier entries in the series. In fact, they don't feel experimental at all. The both play around a gimmick (Stickers in SS and colour splashes in CS) and the story is very shallow in both of them. Not at all at the level of tTYD or SPM. I do feel like I should give a lot of credit to the graphics in these games. A game has never looked so paperly before. The dialogues in CS are great too, it's just a shame that there are no unique characters (like in tTYD) backing those up.\n\nThere are cases when Nintendo experiments a little too much, forgetting what made the series great in the process (Star Fox or Metroid are good examples of this). However, I cannot think of any other series than Paper Mario by Nintendo where they experiment too little, and thus going away from the charm of earlier entries.\n\nOverall I feel like Nintendo should listen more to their fans. They could start by localizing Mother 3.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Eirian Odalis", "channel": "UC1aGPFAMbPS0lRf106rkEEg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxnFVPquEbxzSQusCupO6lVeKKSnrVzR1aizVqS=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

I really liked Color Splash, but it was very unsuccessful because people were aware of sticker star, it was a late Wii U release, and on top of all that, it costed 60 bucks at launch.\n\nHonestly, I am deeply saddened by this.  The game has fun writing, gameplay that isn't as dull as everyone makes it out to be, really good exploration, and a, though non-strategic, quirky battle system.  Also the ost is godlike and I'm surprised at least half of it isn't on this list yet like wow it's great, and people that don't even like this game agree with me on that.\n\nIt probably won't get ported to the Switch, so if you have a Wii U, try it out at least. It's on equal terms with 64.  I think people compare it to the other games too much, but the lack of RPG elements isn't everything.  From an objective standpoint, this game has more engaging exploration than TTYD, but I digress.\n\nIn conclusion, this game isn't exactly the next SPM or TTYD, but it's an enjoyable experience nonetheless.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Nathan Thames", "channel": "UCk4lfCfUrkY6ZnmJo4djPHA", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyLzRgaqfTfq4M0i6PVe-Z0jfuqi3kI8ZcBA1OiBus=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
