It's not nostalgia that makes this game your favorite in the series - it's the simple objective fact that this is the best of them, bar none. MGS 1 is rightfully known as a classic. Everything after it is just the series digging itself a deeper and deeper hole.\n\nI think the defining element of this game's success was the creative restraint that guided all aspects of its design and presentation. There were supernatural elements, but they were low-key, played well into the fiction, and given just enough explanation to make them seem almost plausible in the game's semi-realistic setting. There were intentionally cheesy lines, but the cheesiness was balanced against a heavy atmosphere and good narrative progression - not to mention moments between characters that had a more natural and genuine flavor.\n\nI'm on a tangent. It's just that MGS 1 was a flash-in-the-pan zenith. Sequels threw the nuance and careful creative restraint right out the window. MGS 1 was a hard-hitting techno-noir espionage thriller. MGS 2 was a piece of cut-rate anime garbage whose whole schtick was coyly telling the player that it knew it wasn't half as good as the game that had come before. And it only got worse from there.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Wallipalloo", "channel": "UCD_S5aeYNWj8HBkVQ_PqsFA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxy13PvlV8RzS32ZxTuk3vtdNBY3V2PpAZTqw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
