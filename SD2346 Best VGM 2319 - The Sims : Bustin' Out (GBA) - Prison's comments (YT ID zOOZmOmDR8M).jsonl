A lot of portable Sims games are weird adventure games pretty enjoyable. But if I had to recommand you one and only one Sims-branded game, it would be MySims Agents on Wii. The whole MySims franchise has nothing to do with a simulation game, and is great in my opinion. MySims Agents is an amazing puzzle-adventure game with an intelligent story and a lot of humor. It worth a shot (soundtrack is good too, especially for MySims Kingdom.. Shinji Hosoe and Ayako Saso did MySims Party's Wii soundtrack!)", "time": "10 months ago (edited)", "author": "Mattrio", "channel": "UCu6Zn6vvcN235QMN_lD7sMg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxZoYGwiBuXDv71Rse0lwKzxp9b28E0GveqZyTQ2w=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
