That almost inevitably led me to being disappointed and I feel like I may have not given it a fair shake. I did like the game even back then, however. What I can say for sure is that Mitsuda created an amazing soundtrack... while also somehow composing one of my most hated battle themes. Dragon's Prayer is one of my favorites and when Mitsuda composed some tracks for Shadow Hearts 1&2, his use of guitar would always remind me of this theme's.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "34", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
