{"cid": "UgjUw9tSkQEmWngCoAEC", "text": "After 3 short and entertaining games, it's good to see the developers taking the next step and create such a solid Metroidvania. The great pixelart and music immediately impressed me and the gameplay felt spot on. Sometimes you play a game and it only takes a couple minutes to know that you will like it. Some of the areas (mainly the darker ones) and the way the are structured really reminded me of the real Metroidvanias. It's also very well balanced and provides a good challenge. I'm already excited for a sequel and hopefully they can expand it even more and add a weapons system.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "16", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
