The game was so good, with great combat and a really sad and heartbreaking story! Alex is a nicely written character!\n\nOne thing people can’t stop complaining about is how it featured Pyramid Head. I would like to ask “these” fans if they have ever taken their time to actually follow the original director’s vision on it. Basically, Pyramid head isn’t only unique to James from Silent Hill 2, but is instead the universal symbol for punishment in Silent Hill. You had even seen dark world paintings of it in Silent Hill origins, so how could it be unique to only one game?\n\nAnyways, the story was really beautiful in this game, and it had a really good cover art as well. Also, the history of Shepherd’s Glenn was really interconnected with the Silent Hill history, and had details filled in every corner.
