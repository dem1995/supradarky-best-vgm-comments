I admit it is a great RPG, with such beautiful musics, and a lot of good idea (the tools system is great, the fights are great and interesting). But, in the same time, I was playing Final Fantasy VII (for the 4 or 5th time haha), and I think FFVII is better than WA. \nIn terms of graphics first, I liked the graphics of WA, but FFVII 3D in the fight is better by far than WA.Then, in terms of story and scenario, the 3 characters of WA have a very interesting background, but the main story is not as great as FFVII (it is my personal opinion). And to conclude, the materia system of FFVII is one of the greatest capacity system of all RPGs I've played, and, even though the Fast Draw technics of Jack are great, it is not as good as the materias.\n\nTo conclude, I really liked Wild Arms, the dungeons with the tools are really great, and I had few surprises with the story.
