Seriously though, Odyssey is like the best selling game on the Switch and you haven't even played it!? O_O\nThis is what I think of Super Mario Odyssey, I find that game to be the best 3D Super Mario platformer in a longest time, even better than any of the recent Super Mario releases (Especially Super Mario 3D World which I find that game disappointing when it comes to originality and revolution, not a bad game, but still.), which is saying a lot.\nHonestly Supradarky, what are you waiting for? Go get Super Mario Odyssey, you'll regret for not putting that game in your GOTY of 2017 list.

{"cid": "Ugz4acUujnLkNUToqy14AaABAg", "text": "It was funny to see the 180 for this game's reception, from being extremely sceptical due to the rabbid's involvement, to being cautiously excited after its E3 reveal, and then very well reviewed at its release. I feel like I played this game at a perfect time, I was due for a strategy RPG and a light hearted adventure, which it provides both. Let's get this out of the way: the rabbids are not only fine in this game, but they add to the experience. The humor is one of the highlights of the game and the rabbids are a big part of it (my favorite being Rabbid Peach). The graphics and music are gorgeous, but it's the addictive battle gameplay that completely pulled me in. The key element? Mobility. This is probably my favorite SRPG in terms of what they do with your units' mobility. The variety of ways you can mix your attacks and movements is the single biggest highlight of the game and watching your unit move around, go inside a pipe, melee charge 2-3 monsters in its way, jump on a friendly character, land on a monster for more damage, hide behind cover and shoot from afar in a single movement never got tiring. I also loved how each character has unique strengths and weaknesses, even though it's too bad some of them joined too late in the game. The difficulty in the main story was well balanced, but I somehow had more trouble at the start than at the end. I'm excited for the Donkey Kong DLC and can't wait to see what's next from the team at Ubisoft.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "47", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
