The Fortress of Doom totally spoils the ending of Rise of the Sinistrals in the first five minutes.\n\nThe trade-off being that it left me very disappointed when I finally did play Lufia 1, to the point where I initially hated the game, although I've since grown to like it. Not because I had unreasonably high expectations (it was made earlier, so naturally I expected it to not be as good), but because it didn't deliver in the ways I expected. Most notably, the puzzles. I went into Lufia 1 assuming those were a staple of the series, only to find the first game's dungeons to be generically dull and empty; the most bare-bones dungeons can be. Nor did it have things like capsule monsters, weapon/armor skills, or anything from Lufia 2 that's roots I expected to see in the first game.", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "gurvmlk", "channel": "UC_7wO34faF_aSkuQUO3vr_w", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxvqFItHuUytNtP8wJtSU6_Q5nqIo9QYeDogDlE=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
