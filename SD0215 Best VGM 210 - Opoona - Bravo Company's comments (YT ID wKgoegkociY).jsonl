While battling is still the main focus, you're capable of doing multiple different jobs throughout the game, like an attendant or fortune teller. Some of these are mandatory for beating the game, while others are optional. \nBattle-wise, it's a time-based battle system, but with an energy meter instead of a timer. When you're energy is at max, you can either throw your bonbon (the ball on the character's head) using the control stick in any direction, use an item or use 'force' (magic). How much energy is used is dependant on what move you use and how much you charge the bonbon. There's also a timer for each fight, lasting 2 minuets for normal battle and longer for bosses. Once that timer runs out, your battle ends in a loss. using the enemies positioning to your advantage and management of energy is pretty vital to beating battles smoothly.\nReally, I think the high point of the game are the various domes, they're really expansive and detailed. I didn't really pay much mind to them when I first played it, but I picked up from where I left of after getting stuck for god knows how long and I'm really enjoying it, especially finding the art pieces that are scattered throughout.  \nHowever, there are problems with the game. The translation is a bit of a mess, and as a result it can be difficult to understand what you need to do, and good luck finding a good guide, considering how obscure the game is. The graphics aren't the best, and character models are reused somewhat frequently, and, while this is more of a nitpick than anything, sometimes the battles feel a bit too hectic for their own good. \nAll in all though it's a pretty unique game, It's not that expensive I don't  believe, so if you can find it for a good price and you're a fan of rpgs then I would suggest giving it a go.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "An Evil Mask", "channel": "UC45OZpjKYDZ_o46tKgw8MuQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyHu0f3o-Khsus8Zz6AHXkx4fPrTziaO5TufMKJ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
