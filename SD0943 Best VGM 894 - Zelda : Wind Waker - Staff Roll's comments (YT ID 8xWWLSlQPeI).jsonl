You can find good arguments for each side, but in the end it all comes down to those who prefer a certain atmosphere, those who need a well crafted overworld (something, The Wind Waker definitely lacks) and those who need clever dungeons and puzzles. I could write a book about why The Wind Waker was a huge dissapointment, why Twilight Princess was ambitious, but massivley flawed, why Majora's Mask is one of the best games of all time and why Skyward Sword is exactly what I hoped for in a successor to the series.
