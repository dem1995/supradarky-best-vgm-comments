{"cid": "UgwYO1j_7hPqA0HZubB4AaABAg", "text": "Whew, back from my badly timed business trip! This was one of the games I was most excited about entering 2017, coming from a developer I'm a big fan of (Zeboyd). A retro RPG with elements of Chrono Trigger, set in a Sci-Fi universe? Count me in! The setting is by far my favorite part of this game, with amazing pixel art and a great soundtrack. I also really liked how they tried something new with the battle system, which is about timing the skills you can only use once until you \"waste\" a turn to recharge them. I do think the difficulty + characters balance was sometimes off. The story was the part I found the least interesting as I did not find it memorable, same goes with cast of characters even if quite varied as they were mostly underdeveloped. Overall, I thought this was an ambitious game from Zeboyd and while it didn't fully meet my lofty expectations, its unique setting makes me glad it simply exists. Bring on Zeboyd's next project!", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "20", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

I liked some of them, but I really wish the game had some Chrono Trigger type of side quests that focused around the characters and developed them a little more. Well whatever, The game was still amazing and Hyper Duck still has some of the best music in the indie scene.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "JameboHayabusa", "channel": "UCBAH59QpCJ1_86KkBGIat2Q", "votes": 0, "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxpyblRBgMaFXaLhUG4GWxGNGdyTVfG-SvMBpGP0A=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
