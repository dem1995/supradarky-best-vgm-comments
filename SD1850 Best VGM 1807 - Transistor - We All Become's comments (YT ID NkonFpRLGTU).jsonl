{"cid": "UgjOjEai6Rk5OXgCoAEC", "text": "I finished this game yesterday. I thought the game was as good as Bastion, which is to say that I liked it but nowhere near as much as the general opinion I've seen on it. The graphics are top notch, the soundtrack is great and the unique setting gets you immersed in it. I found the core gameplay very satisfying once you understand it, but once I felt like I had a lot of tools and started to master different strategies, the game was over. Just like with Bastion, I feel like they developed a great gameplay system but it's never fully realised and fleshed out, hindered in part by the low enemy variety. The story is another aspect I was once again not a big fan of, being told in a way that feels more convoluted than it should be. I respect Greg Kasavin very much, especially when he was a game reviewer, but I just can't seem to connect with his writing in the games he works on.
