{"cid": "UgyKsPtplBT_aVt-6gh4AaABAg", "text": "Just like with Undertale and Toby Fox, this game was fully created by 1 person in Kasey Ozymy. This game has always been on my radar due to its Earthbound esthetics and having received many recommendations to play it, I can confirm this is a special game. Every now and then I'll recommend indie games that I feel are in the \"amazing\" territory and this one joined the club. If a unique game that mixes Earthbound with 2 others indies LISA and OFF sounds appealing to you, play this game. Without spoiling too much, this game hides something behind its bright first impression. It has an awesome cast of characters and the hero can use his empathy to transform into various forms of enemies he fought, each with their level and skills, which gives you a lot of possibilities to create a unique team tailored to your preferences. It also features the best Steal system I've seen: let's say you face someone holding a knife, you can steal his weapon at a set % chance and if you succeed, his sprite will change and he'll be looking sad without his knife (and attack power). This is an awesome game with a great soundtrack and plenty of side quests that should not be missed (one of them I still think about). Last thing, I played this game onEasy difficulty which probably cut about 10-20 hours of grinding as it doubles Experience. I usually play with the Default difficulty, but Easy is very much recommended here.
