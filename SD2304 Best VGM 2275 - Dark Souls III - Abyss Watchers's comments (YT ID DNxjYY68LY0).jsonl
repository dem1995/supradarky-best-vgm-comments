The Abyss Watchers fight is what gave me the most trouble so far, but it wasn't too bad. I do have a feeling things will get very serious now that I reached Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. There's just something about FromSoftware's world building, design and gameplay, they are masters in their craft. One thing for sure, I don't know how people actually enjoy and remember these boss themes because I'm so stressed and focused that I barely realize what's playing. My hands rarely get sweaty, but this series does it. It's actually when I listen to the soundtrack afterwards that I truly appreciate the compositions.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "SupraDarky", "channel": "UC6iBH7Pmiinoe902-JqQ7aQ", "votes": "47", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz-WP37CKyRsSGpodj0KF2a556urv8yhxQQEuPB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}

Not only am I distracted by having to focus on the bosses, but the music is also quiet in the overall game sound. Since no music plays during regular level exploration anyway, it works out well for me and it really helps me appreciate the awe-inspiring compositions.\nEnjoy Dark Souls 3!
