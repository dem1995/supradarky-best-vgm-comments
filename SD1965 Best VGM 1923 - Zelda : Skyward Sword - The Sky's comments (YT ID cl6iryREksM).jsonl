I knew it would be something special, but I wasn't ready for this. The trailer made me happy, but seeing the hours of gameplay on the Treehouse stream is what really blew me away. I keep searching for new gameplay videos, I can't get enough of them and I can't wait to play Nintendo's take on an open world. The amount of details and gameplay elements I've seen already is very exciting, and I'm glad to see more RPG elements show up. Being able to jump will deliver Link from a more static world. Climbing as well. The puzzles will also be promising thanks to the physics engine.
