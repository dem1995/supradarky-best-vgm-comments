This was when I understood from the online community that apparently you need to decipher some gibberish scribble nonsense and then some more crazy puzzles that were never a part of the learning curve through game play and the only way to know what to do is to go online and listen the exclamatory guides. It is like playing chess and all the sudden The opponent laying down a hand of cards exclaiming BlackJack and snatching your queen. The developers could not make up puzzles with the environment of the game so instead they bypassed all that and just placed some absolute travesty of riddles. This is because they failed to understand the mechanics of the game so they had to bypass it with whale secret alphabets and bird poop riddles that only the mad hatter can try to solve if he has enough tea from wild mushrooms. That's what happened when you steel a game mechanic that you don't understand and than bypass it with your own idea that only makes sense to you and no body else", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Alexander Amur", "channel": "UCYB3D35HvcMAaVA9llVHsVg", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxiGT24M_j3auNXk46a2-9WzYgn0BcrjQeXGJg0=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo"}
